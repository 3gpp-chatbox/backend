1. Mobility Management (MM):  These procedures handle the UE's registration, tracking, and handover as it moves within the network.

Registration: (Initial Registration, Periodic Registration, Mobility Registration) Allows the UE to register with the network and update its location information.
Deregistration: Allows the UE to deregister from the network.   
Tracking Area Update (TAU): Updates the UE's location information as it moves between tracking areas.
Handover: Facilitates the handover of the UE from one cell to another.

2. Session Management (SM):  These procedures manage the establishment, modification, and release of PDU (Protocol Data Unit) sessions, which are used for data communication.

PDU Session Establishment: Establishes a PDU session between the UE and the network.   
PDU Session Modification: Modifies an existing PDU session (e.g., changes QoS parameters).   
PDU Session Release: Releases a PDU session.

3. Authentication and Security:  These procedures ensure the secure connection between the UE and the network.

Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA): Authenticates the UE and establishes security keys.   
5G Security Association Establishment: Sets up security associations between the UE and the network.

4. Other Important Procedures:

Configuration Update: Allows the network to update the UE's configuration.   
Notification: Used by the network to notify the UE about certain events.
Emergency Call: Handles emergency calls.
Location Services: Supports location services.

1.1 Mobility Management (MM) - Registration:
1. Initial Registration:

Purpose: This is the first registration a UE performs when it powers on or enters the 5G network for the first time. It's how the UE introduces itself to the network.
Key Steps (Simplified):
The UE sends a Registration Request message to the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function). This message includes the UE's identity, the type of registration (initial), and other relevant information.
The AMF authenticates the UE, often involving the UDM (Unified Data Management) for verifying the UE's credentials.
The AMF updates the UDM with the UE's registration details.
The AMF selects an appropriate SMF (Session Management Function) if the UE requests services requiring a PDU session.
The AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE, confirming the registration and assigning a temporary identifier (GUTI - Globally Unique Temporary Identifier).
The UE acknowledges the Registration Accept, completing the initial registration.

2. Periodic Registration:
Purpose: After a successful initial registration, the UE performs periodic registrations to keep its registration active. This tells the network that the UE is still present and reachable. It's like a "heartbeat" signal.
Key Steps (Simplified):
The UE sends a Registration Request message (type: periodic) to the AMF at regular intervals.
The AMF may perform a simplified authentication.
The AMF updates the UDM (if necessary).
The AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE, renewing the registration period.

3. Mobility Registration:
Purpose: The UE performs a mobility registration when it moves to a new Tracking Area (TA). A TA is a geographical area within which the UE can move without needing to update its location with the network. When the UE crosses TA boundaries, it performs a mobility registration to inform the network of its new location.
Key Steps (Simplified):
The UE detects that it has entered a new TA (based on broadcast information from the network).
The UE sends a Registration Request message (type: mobility registration) to the AMF.
The AMF updates the UE's location information in the UDM.
The AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE, confirming the mobility registration.
Key Information Elements in Registration Messages:

UE Identity: Identifies the UE.
Registration Type: Indicates the type of registration (initial, periodic, mobility).
GUTI: Globally Unique Temporary Identifier, a temporary ID assigned to the UE.
Tracking Area Identity (TAI): Identifies the Tracking Area.
Requested Network Services: Specifies the services the UE wants to access.
