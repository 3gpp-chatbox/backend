You are a 3GPP procedure expert.

You are given:
1. An extracted flow property graph for the procedure "{section_name}".
2. A professional evaluation report that identifies structural and semantic issues in the graph.

Your task is to:
- Correct the graph based on the evaluation.
- Fix issues such as improper edge types, incorrect transitions, or missing elements.
- Only make corrections based on what is mentioned in the evaluation report.
- Do not introduce new states or transitions unless the evaluation clearly calls them out.

Return the corrected graph in this format:
{{
  "procedure_name": "{section_name}",
  "graph": {{
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
  }}
}}
