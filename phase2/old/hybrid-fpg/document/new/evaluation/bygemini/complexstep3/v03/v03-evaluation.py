 I will provide you with two parts:  

1. **First part**: My extracted procedure flow property graph information about the 3GPP procedure "Registration procedure for initial registration."  
2. **Second part**: The original content of "Registration procedure for initial registration" from the 3GPP NAS specification.  

Please use the second part (the original 3GPP document) to correct any errors or missing information in the first part (my extracted data). For any discrepancies or omissions, indicate the corresponding content in the original document so I can verify them myself later.  

**Strict Rule**: Use **only** the provided text. Do **not** infer or add missing details.  

Let’s begin.  

#### **Extracted procedure flow property graph info:**  

{json.dumps(extracted_data, indent=2)}

------------------
This is second part:
#### **orginal content from 3gpp specification:**  
{original_content}

After comparing the two, please:
Correct any inaccuracies or missing details in the extracted data based on the original specification.
Provide an accuracy score (1-100%) for the extracted data.
Reference the exact content in the original document where corrections are needed, so I can cross-check.
**Strict Rule**: Use **only** the provided text. Do **not** infer or add missing details.
