1. Structure of the 3GPP Specification
The structure you provided is from 3GPP TS 24.501, which defines the Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for 5G. The section 5.5.1.2 describes the Registration procedure for initial registration, and under it, there are several sub-procedures (or sub-sections) that collectively define the entire procedure.

2. Main Procedure vs. Sub-Procedures
Main Procedure: Registration procedure for initial registration (5.5.1.2)
This is the overarching procedure that defines how a UE performs initial registration with the 5G network. It encompasses all the steps, conditions, and behaviors required for the UE to register with the network.

Sub-Procedures:
These are the individual steps or components that make up the main procedure. Each sub-procedure focuses on a specific aspect of the initial registration process. For example:

5.5.1.2.2 Initial registration initiation: Describes how the UE initiates the registration procedure (e.g., sending the REGISTRATION REQUEST message).

5.5.1.2.3 5GMM common procedure initiation: Describes the initiation of common procedures (e.g., authentication, security setup) that may be triggered during initial registration.

5.5.1.2.4 Initial registration accepted by the network: Describes the steps when the network accepts the registration request (e.g., sending the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message).

5.5.1.2.5 Initial registration not accepted by the network: Describes the steps when the network rejects the registration request (e.g., sending the REGISTRATION REJECT message).

5.5.1.2.6 Initial registration for emergency services not accepted by the network: Describes the steps when the network rejects an emergency registration request.

5.5.1.2.6A Initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session not accepted by the network: Describes the steps when the network rejects an emergency PDU session request.

5.5.1.2.7 Abnormal cases in the UE: Describes how the UE handles abnormal situations during the registration procedure.

5.5.1.2.8 Abnormal cases on the network side: Describes how the network handles abnormal situations during the registration procedure.

3. Combining Sub-Procedures
The main procedure (Registration procedure for initial registration) is essentially a combination of all these sub-procedures.

Each sub-procedure defines a specific part of the overall process, and together, they provide a complete description of how the UE and network interact during initial registration.

4. Why This Structure?
The 3GPP specification uses this hierarchical structure to:

Break down complexity: The initial registration procedure is complex, so breaking it into smaller, manageable sub-procedures makes it easier to understand and implement.

Enable modularity: Each sub-procedure can be studied or implemented independently, which is useful for developers and engineers.

Handle edge cases: Sub-procedures like "Abnormal cases in the UE" and "Abnormal cases on the network side" ensure that all possible scenarios (including errors) are covered.

5. Your Understanding is Correct
Yes, the Registration procedure for initial registration is the main procedure.

Under it, there are several sub-procedures (e.g., Initial registration initiation, 5GMM common procedure initiation, etc.).

When you combine all these sub-procedures, you get the complete Registration procedure for initial registration.

6. Example Flow
Hereâ€™s how the sub-procedures fit into the main procedure:

Initial registration initiation: UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

5GMM common procedure initiation: Network may initiate authentication or security setup.

Initial registration accepted by the network: Network sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

Initial registration not accepted by the network: Network sends a REGISTRATION REJECT message.

Abnormal cases: Handle errors or unexpected behaviors on the UE or network side.

7. Conclusion
Your understanding is correct! The Registration procedure for initial registration is the main procedure, and it is composed of several sub-procedures that describe specific aspects of the process. Together, these sub-procedures provide a complete description of how initial registration works in 5G.
