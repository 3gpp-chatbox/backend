1. Document Processing (Automated)
A script chunks and stores a DOCX document into a database.
2. Section Identification (Manual)
You manually review the document to find the start and end paragraphs of the section you need.
3. Chunk ID Retrieval (Manual)
You search the identified text in the database to locate the chunk IDs (e.g., ID 625 to ID 765).
4. Targeted Data Extraction (Automated)
A script queries SQLite to extract content only from the identified chunk range.
5. AI Processing (Automated)
The extracted content is sent to a Generative AI model to generate key information, descriptions, and Mermaid flowchart code.
The AI response is automatically saved to a .txt file.
6. Mermaid Code Extraction (Manual)
You manually copy only the Mermaid flowchart code from the AI response.
You create a new .mmd file and paste the Mermaid code.
7. Mermaid Code Debugging (Manual & API-Assisted)
Sometimes, the AI-generated Mermaid code contains syntax errors.
You copy-paste the code into a browser and use an API (e.g., GPT) to correct it.
Once corrected, you copy-paste the valid Mermaid code back into the .mmd file.
