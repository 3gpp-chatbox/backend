Okay, I will analyze the provided text and extract information about the "Registration procedure for initial registration" as described in section 5.5.1.2.2.

**Procedure: Registration procedure for initial registration**

**Description:** This procedure is initiated by the UE to register for 5GS services, emergency services, SMS over NAS, onboarding services in SNPN, disaster roaming services or resume normal services.

**Key Information and Description:**

*   **Trigger:** The procedure is triggered when the UE needs to perform initial registration for various services or when moving to NG-RAN from GERAN/UTRAN.
*   **State:** UE starts in the `5GMM-DEREGISTERED` state and transitions to `InitialRegistrationInitiation` state.
*   **Action:** The UE sends a `REGISTRATION REQUEST` message to the AMF.
*   **Timers:** UE starts timer T3510 and stops timer T3502 and timer T3511 if they are running.
*   **5GS Registration Type IE**: Indicates the type of registration being performed (initial, emergency, SNPN onboarding, disaster roaming).
*    **5GS mobile identity IE**: Contains the UE's identity.
*   **Mobility:** Includes handling of moving from EPC (4G) to 5G.
*   **NSSAI**: Handles the network slice selection by including requested NSSAI and handling configured/allowed NSSAI.
*   **Capabilities:** Indicates UE capabilities via the `5GMM capability IE` and `S1 UE network capability IE`, covering a wide range of features.
*	**UE policy**: Indicate if the UE has one or more stored UE policy sections
*   **Security**:  Handles NAS security context and encryption of IEs.
*   **Disaster Roaming**: Includes specific handling for disaster roaming scenarios, including the UE determined PLMN with disaster condition IE.
*   **Emergency Services:** UE shall indicate "emergency registration" in the 5GS registration type IE.
