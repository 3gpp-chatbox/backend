Okay, I will analyze the provided text to extract information about the main procedure described, mapping it to the requested JSON format.

**Analysis:**

The primary focus of the text is the **UE Initial Registration Procedure**. The text details the conditions under which a UE initiates this procedure, the information elements (IEs) included in the `REGISTRATION REQUEST` message, and the handling of various scenarios during the registration process. The text specifies different conditions and parameters based on the UE's capabilities, network configurations (PLMN, SNPN), and the type of registration (e.g., emergency, onboarding).

**JSON Representation:**

**Key Information and Descriptions:**

*   **Procedure:** UE Initial Registration.
*   **Trigger:** Various events, including coverage changes, roaming scenarios, and initial service requests.
*   **Message:** `REGISTRATION REQUEST`
*   **Destination:** AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function).
*   **Key IEs (Information Elements):**
    *   `5GS Mobile Identity`: Contains the UE's identity (5G-GUTI, SUCI, or PEI).
    *   `5GMM capability IE`: Indicates the UE's supported features and capabilities.
    *   `Requested NSSAI`: Indicates the slices the UE intends to register with.
    *   `UE Status`: Indicates the UE's EMM registration status (relevant for interworking scenarios).
*   **Timers:**
    *   `T3510`: Timer started after sending the `REGISTRATION REQUEST`.
    *   `T3502`: Timer stopped if running when registration starts.
     *   `T3511`: Timer stopped if running when registration starts.
    *   `T3519`: Timer started when SUCI is included

*   **Conditional Behavior:** The content of the `REGISTRATION REQUEST` varies significantly based on:
    *   The UE's previous registration state (S1 mode, 5G).
    *   The type of network (PLMN, SNPN).
    *   The presence of valid identities (5G-GUTI, SUCI).
    *   The UE's supported features (e.g., MICO mode, DRX, NSSAI).
    *   Emergency service requirements.
