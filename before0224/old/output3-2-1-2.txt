Based on the provided text, the procedures mentioned are:

1. Registration procedure for initial registration
2. 5GMM common procedure initiation
3. Initial registration accepted by the network
4. Initial registration not accepted by the network
5. Abnormal cases in the UE
6. Abnormal cases on the network side
7. Registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
8. Initial registration for emergency services not accepted by the network
9. Initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session not accepted by the network


**Procedure 2: 5GMM common procedure initiation**
