**Explanation and Improvements:**

*   **Procedure Name:**  Clearly states the procedure being modeled.
*   **Description:** Provides a concise overview of the procedure's purpose.
*   **Initiator and Participants:** Identifies the network elements involved.
*   **Normal Flow:** A numbered list of steps describing the typical message exchange and actions.  Timers and Information Elements (IEs) are included for each step.
*   **Abnormal Cases (Network & UE):** Lists potential error scenarios and the corresponding actions taken by the AMF and UE. This is crucial for a complete picture.
*   **Key Information:** Summarizes important messages, timers, and IEs used in the procedure.  This serves as a quick reference.
*   **FPG Visualization:**
    *   **Clear Nodes:** Each node represents a key action or state of an entity (UE or AMF).  Nodes are labeled descriptively.
    *   **Directed Edges:** Arrows show the flow of the procedure.
    *   **Message Labels:** Edges are labeled with the messages exchanged between entities.
    *   **Subgraphs for Abnormal Cases:** These visually separate error handling flows from the main procedure.  Clearer that these are *interruptions* or alternative paths.
    *   **Collision handling** collision cases are directed to an End, showing these branches terminates the normal flow

Key improvements in this approach:

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes both the normal flow and common error scenarios for the UE and Network, based on the provided text.
*   **Detailed Information:** Incorporates messages, timers, and IEs to create a more technically accurate model.
*   **Clear Visualization:** The FPG uses subgraphs and labels effectively to communicate the procedure's logic.

This structured approach will allow for a more in-depth understanding of 3GPP specifications, making it easier to implement and test these complex procedures.
