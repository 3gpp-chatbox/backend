SyntaxError: f-string: valid expression required before '}'


The error you're encountering is due to a syntax issue in your f-string. Specifically, the f-string is not properly formatted, and there are some issues with the JSON structure you're trying to embed within it. Let's break down the issues and fix them:

Invalid JSON Structure: The JSON structure you provided has some syntax errors, such as missing commas between objects in the nodes array.

F-string Formatting: The f-string is not properly formatted, especially when embedding multi-line JSON structures.
