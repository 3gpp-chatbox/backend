You are a 3GPP specification expert. Your task is to analyze the provided 3GPP 24.501 procedure taxonomy and metadata structure and generate a JSON representation of it.  The JSON should capture the hierarchical relationships between categories, procedures, and their sub-features, as well as incorporate the metadata elements.

**Taxonomy Structure for 3GPP 24.501 Procedures:**

1. **Top-Level Categories:**
   - Registration Procedures
   - Session Management Procedures

2. **Second-Level: Individual Procedures:**
   - Registration Procedures:
     - Initial Registration
     - Periodic Registration
     - Deregistration
   - Session Management Procedures:
     - Session Establishment
     - Session Modification
     - Session Release

3. **Sub-Features for Each Procedure:**
   - **Initial Registration:**
     - Trigger: Device power-on, network selection
     - State: Idle state
     - Cause: New device registration, network re-entry
     - Expected Outcomes: Successful registration, error handling
     - Error Handling: Steps for failure, retry mechanisms
     - Feedback Loops: Error reporting, retry notifications
   - **Session Establishment:**
     - Trigger: User request, network initiation
     - State: Connected state
     - Cause: New service request, network allocation
     - Expected Outcomes: Successful session setup, error handling
     - Error Handling: Session setup failure, recovery steps
     - Feedback Loops: Session status updates, error reporting

**Metadata Integration:**

- **Constraints and Requirements:** Network availability, resource allocation
- **Message Types:** NAS messages, RRC messages
- **References:** Sections 5.1, 5.2, etc.
- **Excerpts:** Direct quotes from the specification
- **Identifiers:** Unique procedure IDs

**Instructions:**

1.  Create a JSON object that represents the taxonomy. The top-level keys should be the top-level categories ("Registration Procedures", "Session Management Procedures").
2.  Each top-level category should contain an array of procedure objects.
3.  Each procedure object should have the following keys:
    -   `procedure_name` (string): The name of the procedure (e.g., "Initial Registration").
    -   `sub_features` (object): An object containing the sub-features as key-value pairs (e.g., "Trigger": "Device power-on, network selection").
    -   `metadata` (object): An object containing the metadata elements as key-value pairs (e.g., "Constraints and Requirements": "Network availability, resource allocation").
4.  The JSON object should *only* represent the taxonomy and metadata as described above. Do not include any explanatory text or other information.  Ensure it is valid JSON.

**Example (Partial JSON):**

```json
{
  "Registration Procedures": [
    {
      "procedure_name": "Initial Registration",
      "sub_features": {
        "Trigger": "Device power-on, network selection",
        "State": "Idle state",
        "Cause": "New device registration, network re-entry",
        "Expected Outcomes": "Successful registration, error handling",
        "Error Handling": "Steps for failure, retry mechanisms",
        "Feedback Loops": "Error reporting, retry notifications"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "Constraints and Requirements": "Network availability, resource allocation",
        "Message Types": "NAS messages, RRC messages",
        "References": "Sections 5.1, 5.2, etc.",
        "Excerpts": "Direct quotes from the specification",
        "Identifiers": "Unique procedure IDs"
      }
    },
    // ... more procedures
  ],
  "Session Management Procedures": [
     // ... procedures and their sub-features and metadata
  ]
}
Return only the complete, valid JSON object.
