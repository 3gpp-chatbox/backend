Okay, I will analyze the provided text, focusing on the primary procedure described, extracting its core components, and representing it in a structured format including key information, description and a Mermaid flowchart.

**Main Procedure: Identification Procedure**

Based on the provided text, the main procedure described is the **Identification Procedure** initiated by the network (AMF).

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Name:** Identification Procedure
*   **Purpose:** To request a UE to provide specific identification parameters (SUCI, IMEI, IMEISV, EUI-64, MAC address).
*   **Initiator:** AMF (Network)
*   **UE State:** 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
*   **Trigger:** Network needs to identify the UE.

**Procedure Flow:**

1.  **Initiation:** AMF sends IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE and starts timer T3570.
2.  **UE Action (Reception of IDENTITY REQUEST):**
    *   **If** Identity type IE is NOT set to "SUCI": UE sends IDENTITY RESPONSE message containing the requested identification parameters.
    *   **If** Identity type IE is set to "SUCI":
        *   **If** timer T3519 is not running: UE generates a fresh SUCI, sends IDENTITY RESPONSE with the SUCI, starts timer T3519, and stores the SUCI value.
        *   **If** timer T3519 is running: UE sends IDENTITY RESPONSE message with the stored SUCI.
3.  **Network Action (Reception of IDENTITY RESPONSE):** AMF stops timer T3570.
4.  **Abnormal Cases (UE):**
    *   Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE (triggered by registration): UE re-initiates registration.
    *   Requested identity is not available: UE encodes identity type as "No identity".
5.  **Abnormal Cases (Network):**
    *   Lower layer failure: Network aborts any ongoing 5GMM procedure.
    *   Expiry of timer T3570: Network retransmits IDENTITY REQUEST (up to 4 times). After 5th expiry, network aborts identification procedure and any ongoing 5GMM procedure.
    *   Collision with registration procedures (initial/emergency): Network handles based on various conditions (described in detail in the text).
    *   Collision with registration procedures (mobility/periodic): Network progresses both procedures.
    *   Collision with UE initiated de-registration procedure: Behavior depends on "switch off" indication.

**Key Information and Description:**

*   **IDENTITY REQUEST:** Message sent by the AMF to request the UE's identity. It includes the Identity type IE.
*   **IDENTITY RESPONSE:** Message sent by the UE containing the requested identification parameters or an indication that the identity is not available.
*   **SUCI:** A privacy-preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI.
*   **Timer T3570:** Timer used by the network to manage the identification procedure. Retransmission occurs upon expiry, and the procedure is aborted after multiple retries.
*   **Timer T3519:** Timer used by the UE when SUCI is requested to prevent SUCI generation too frequently.
*   **5GMM-CONNECTED:** The UE must be in this mode for the procedure to occur.
