Okay, let's analyze the provided text and extract the information about the 5GMM status procedure.

**Procedure:** 5GMM Status Procedure

**Core Components:**

*   **Purpose:** To report error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol data in the AMF or UE.
*   **Initiator:** Both AMF and UE can send the 5GMM STATUS message.
*   **Trigger:** Detection of an error condition related to 5GMM protocol data.
*   **Message:** 5GMM STATUS.
*   **Action (UE - Upon Receipt):** No state transition or specific action is mandated from the radio interface perspective. Local actions are implementation-dependent.
*   **Action (AMF - Upon Receipt):** No state transition or specific action is mandated from the radio interface perspective. Local actions are implementation-dependent.

**Key Information and Description:**

The 5GMM status procedure is a mechanism for the AMF or UE to report errors encountered during the processing of 5GMM messages. The specification emphasizes that the receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message does not trigger any mandatory state transitions or actions from a radio interface perspective. The actions taken are left to the individual implementations.
