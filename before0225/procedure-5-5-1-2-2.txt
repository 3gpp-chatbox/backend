Okay, let's analyze the provided 3GPP text to extract the procedure information for the "Initial registration initiation" procedure.

**Procedure Name:** Initial Registration Initiation

**Description:** This section describes the actions a UE in the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state takes to initiate the initial registration procedure by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF. The text outlines various conditions under which the UE initiates this procedure and specifies which IEs (Information Elements) to include in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message based on different scenarios and UE capabilities.

**Key Information & Clarifications:**

*   **UE State:** The UE must be in the `5GMM-DEREGISTERED` state to initiate this procedure.
*   **Registration Causes:**  The procedure is triggered by several reasons, including initial registration for 5GS services, emergency services, SMS over NAS, mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to NG-RAN, onboarding services in SNPN, disaster roaming, or coming out of an unavailability period.
*   **REGISTRATION REQUEST Message:** The core of the procedure involves constructing and sending the `REGISTRATION REQUEST` message.
*   **5GS Mobile Identity IE:**  The UE handles the `5GS mobile identity` IE with priority given to GUTIs assigned by the same PLMN/SNPN, followed by equivalent PLMN/SNPN, then any other PLMN/SNPN. If no valid GUTI is available, it may use a SUCI or PEI (for emergency services). The UE may include an onboarding SUCI if initiating the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN.
*   **NSSAI Handling:** The UE includes the `Requested NSSAI` IE containing the S-NSSAI(s) it intends to register with, based on configured or allowed NSSAI.
*   **5GMM Capability IE:** The UE sets various bits in the `5GMM capability IE` to indicate supported features (e.g., NSAG, RACS, V2X, ProSe, etc.)
*   **Timers:** The UE starts timer T3510 after sending the `REGISTRATION REQUEST` and stops timers T3502 and T3511 if they are running.
*   **Emergency Services Considerations:** There are specific rules for initiating initial registration for emergency services over different access types (3GPP vs. non-3GPP).
