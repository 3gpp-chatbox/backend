### 4.1	Overview
The nonaccess stratum NAS described in the present document forms the highest stratum of the control plane between the UE and the AMF reference point N1 see 3GPP TS 23.501 for both 3GPP and non3GPP access.
Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are
a support of mobility of the user equipment UE including also common procedures such as authentication identification generic UE configuration update and security mode control procedures
b support of session management procedures to establish and maintain data connectivity between the UE and the data network and
c NAS transport procedure to provide a transport of SMS LPP SLPP LCS UPPCMI container UE policy container SOR transparent container and UE parameters update information payload.
Principles for the handing of 5GS security contexts and for the activation of ciphering and integrity protection when a NAS signalling connection is established are provided in subclause 4.4.
For the support of the above functions the following procedures are supplied within this specification
a elementary procedures for 5GS mobility management in clause 5 and
b elementary procedures for 5GS session management in clause 6.
Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as part of the 5GMM common procedures in subclause 5.4.
Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures. Examples of such specific sequences can be found in 3GPP TS 23.502 .
The NAS for 5GS follows the protocol architecture model for layer 3 as described in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
### 4.2	Coordination between the protocols for 5GS mobility management and 5GS session management
A 5GS session management 5GSM message is piggybacked in specific 5GS mobility management 5GMM transport messages. To this purpose the 5GSM messages can be transmitted in an information element in the 5GMM transport messages. In this case the UE the AMF and the SMF execute the 5GMM procedure and the 5GSM procedure in parallel. The success of the 5GMM procedure is not dependent on the success of the piggybacked 5GSM procedure.
The UE can only initiate the 5GSM procedure when there is a 5GMM context established at the UE.
During 5GMM procedures the UE and the AMF shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages except when
a the 5GMM procedure is piggybacking 5GSM messages or
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode and a service request procedure for reestablishing userplane resources of PDU sessions is initiated without including PDU session status IE or Allowed PDU session status IE. In this case the UE and the AMF need not suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages related to other PDU sessions than the ones for which the user plane resources reestablishment is requested.
If the UE determines to locally release the N1 NAS signalling connection upon receiving an SOR transparent container during a registration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 subclause C.2 the UE shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages after sending the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message and until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN with the exception of the case when the UE has an emergency PDU session.
A 5GMM message piggybacking a 5GSM message for a PDU session shall be delivered via the access associated with the PDU session if any with the following exceptions
a the AMF shall send via 3GPP access a DL NAS TRANSPORT message piggybacking a downlink 5GSM message of a networkrequested 5GSM procedure for a PDU session associated with non3GPP access if the conditions specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.4 or subclause 5.6.1.4 are met
b the UE shall send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message piggybacking a response message to the 5GSM message described in a via either
1 3GPP access or
2 non3GPP access if the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access and
NOTE The interaction between the 5GMM sublayer and the 5GSM sublayer to enable the UE to send the UL NAS TRANSPORT message containing the response message via 3GPP access is required. This is achieved via UE implementation.
c the UE shall send via the target access an UL NAS TRANSPORT message piggybacking a 5GSM message associated with a request type set to existing PDU session or existing emergency PDU session for handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
A 5GMM message piggybacking a 5GSM message as a response message to a request message associated with an MA PDU session shall be delivered via the same access that the initial message was received.
### 4.2A	Controlling of UE access technology utilization by 5GS
The network operator may restrict subscribers access to certain access technologies. For this purpose the network may send the RAT utilization control information to the UE to provide RAT utilization control information for the current PLMN or for the current PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs via the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message see subclause 5.5.1.2 and clause 5.5.1.3 the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message see subclause 5.4.4.2 the REGISTRATION REJECT message see subclause 5.5.1.2.5 and subclause 5.5.1.3.5 and the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message see subclause 5.5.2.3.1. The RAT utilization control information is applied in PLMN selection procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 .
Editors note How does the UE handle the received information of restricted RAT indicated in the RAT utilization control IE is FFS.
The UE shall store the received RAT utilization control information together with the PLMN identity of the current PLMN in the list of PLMNs with associated RAT restrictions see 3GPP TS 23.122 . The same list is used by 5GMM EMM GMM and MM. When the UE is switched off it shall keep the stored list so that it can be used after switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list if the USIM is removed. The number of entries that the ME can store in the list of PLMNs with associated RAT restrictions is implementation specific but it shall be at least one.
#### 4.3.1	UE's usage setting
The UEs usage setting defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 applies to voice capable UEs in 5GS and indicates whether the UE has preference for voice services over data services or viceversa where
a voice services include IMS voice and
b data services include any kind of user data transfer without a voice media component.
The UEs usage setting can be set to
a voice centric or
b data centric.
If the UE is capable of S1 mode there is a single UEs usage setting at the UE which applies to both 5GS and EPS.
#### 4.3.2	Domain selection for UE originating sessions / calls
The behaviour of the UE for domain selection is determined by
a the UE usage setting
b the availability of IMS voice and
c whether the UE operates in singleregistration mode or dualregistration mode see 3GPP TS 23.501 .
In the present document the condition the UE supports IMS voice over 3GPP access evaluates to true if at least one of the following is fulfilled
1 the UE supports IMS voice over NR connected to 5GCN
2 the UE supports IMS voice over EUTRA connected to 5GCN or
3 the UE supports IMS voice in EPS.
In the present document the condition the UE does not support IMS voice over 3GPP access evaluates to true if the condition the UE supports IMS voice over 3GPP access evaluates to false.
In the present document the condition the UE supports IMS voice over non3GPP access evaluates to true if the UE supports IMS voice over non3GPP access connected to 5GCN.
In the present document the condition the UE does not support IMS voice over non3GPP access evaluates to true if the condition the UE supports IMS voice over non3GPP access evaluates to false.
In the present document IMS voice not available is determined per access type independently i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access.
In the present document IMS voice not available refers to one of the following conditions
a the UE does not support IMS voice
b the UE supports IMS voice but the network indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported or
c the UE supports IMS voice the network indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are supported but the upper layers
1 provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the IMS within a manufacturer determined period of time or
2 indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.
NOTE 1 If conditions a and b evaluate to false the upper layers need time to attempt IMS registration. In the event an indication from the upper layers that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS takes longer than the manufacturer determined period of time e.g. due to delay when attempting IMS registration or due to delay in obtaining a QoS flow for SIP signalling the NAS layer assumes the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.
Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific.
In the present document IMS voice available applies when IMS voice not available does not apply.
When IMS voice is not available over NGRAN access i.e. over nonsatellite NGRAN cells if the UEs usage setting is voice centric the UE operates in singleregistration mode and the UE
a does not have a persistent PDU session and
1 if the UE is only registered over 3GPP access or if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and IMS voice is not available over non3GPP access the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.2 with modifications described below or
2 if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and IMS voice is available over non3GPP access the UE may disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.2 with modifications described below or
b has a persistent PDU session then the UE waits until the radio bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released. When the radio bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released then
1 if the UE is only registered over 3GPP access or if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and IMS voice is not available over non3GPP accessthe UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.2 with modifications described below or
2 If the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and IMS voice is available over non3GPP access the UE may disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.2 with modifications described below.
When IMS voice is not available over satellite NGRAN access if the UEs usage setting is voice centric the UE operates in singleregistration mode and the UE
a does not have a persistent PDU session then the UE shall disable the satellite NGRAN capability and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.4 or
b has a persistent PDU session then the UE waits until the radio bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released. When the radio bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released then the UE shall disable the satellite NGRAN capability and proceed as specified in subclause 4.9.4.
NOTE 2 In some cases where the PLMN in N1 mode is only available over satellite NGRAN e.g. unique satellite PLMN ID the UE as an implementation option may disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access instead of disabling satellite NGRAN capability.
The following modifications are applied to the procedure in subclause 4.9.2 for disabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if the UEs usage setting is voice centric and the UE operates in singleregistration mode
a in item a of subclause 4.9.2 the UE shall attempt to select an EUTRA cell connected to EPC. If such a cell is found the UE shall then perform voice domain selection procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 and
b in item b of subclause 4.9.2 if an EUTRA cell connected to EPC cannot be found the UE shall attempt to select another supported radio access technology which supports voice services.
When IMS voice is not available over non3GPP access if the UEs usage setting is voice centric and the UE operates in singleregistration mode then
a if the UE is only registered over non3GPP access the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access see subclause 4.9.3 or
b if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and IMS voice is not available also over 3GPP access the UE may disable the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access see subclause 4.9.3.
NOTE 3 The UE can register over 3GPP access in another mode e.g. S1 mode for voice service and in this case the UE can keep the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access enabled.
#### 4.3.3	Change of UE's usage setting
If the UE operates in singleregistration mode whenever the UEs usage setting changes the UE shall execute procedures according to table 4.3.3.1
Table 4.3.3.1 Change of UEs usage setting for a UE in singleregistration mode
#### 4.3.4	Change or determination of IMS voice availability
If the UE operates in singleregistration mode whenever the IMS voice availability is determined or changes the UE shall execute procedures according to table 4.3.4.1
Table 4.3.4.1 Change of IMS voice availability for a UE in singleregistration mode
#### 4.4.1	General
This clause describes the principles for the handling of 5G NAS security contexts in the UE and in the AMF the procedures used for the security protection of NAS messages between the UE and the AMF and the procedures used for the protection of NAS IEs between the UE and the UDM. Security protection involves integrity protection and ciphering of the 5GMM messages. 5GSM messages are security protected indirectly by being piggybacked by the security protected 5GMM messages i.e. UL NAS TRANSPORT message and the DL NAS TRANSPORT message.
The signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are part of the 5GMM protocol and are described in detail in clause 5.
NOTE The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option. In this subclause for the ease of description it is assumed that ciphering is used unless explicitly indicated otherwise. Operation of a network without ciphering is achieved by configuring the AMF so that it always selects the null ciphering algorithm 5GEA0.
###### 4.4.2.1.1	Establishment of 5G NAS security context
The security parameters for authentication integrity protection and ciphering are tied together in a 5G NAS security context and identified by a key set identifier ngKSI. The relationship between the security parameters is defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Before security can be activated the AMF and the UE need to establish a 5G NAS security context. Usually the 5G NAS security context is created as the result of a primary authentication and key agreement procedure between the AMF and the UE. A new 5G NAS security context may also be created during an N1 mode to N1 mode handover. Alternatively during intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the AMF not supporting interworking without N26 and the UE operating in singleregistration mode may derive a mapped 5G NAS security context from an EPS security context that has been established while the UE was in S1 mode.
The 5G NAS security context is taken into use by the UE and the AMF when the AMF initiates a security mode control procedure during an N1 mode to N1 mode handover or during the intersystem change procedure from S1 mode to N1 mode. The 5G NAS security context which has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current 5G NAS security context. This current 5G NAS security context can be of type native or mapped i.e. originating from a native 5G NAS security context or mapped 5G NAS security context.
The key set identifier ngKSI is assigned by the AMF either during the primary authentication and key agreement procedure or for the mapped 5G NAS security context during the intersystem change. The ngKSI consists of a value and a type of security context parameter indicating whether a 5G NAS security context is a native 5G NAS security context or a mapped 5G NAS security context. When the 5G NAS security context is a native 5G NAS security context the ngKSI has the value of KSIAMF and when the current 5G NAS security context is of type mapped the ngKSI has the value of KSIASME.
The 5G NAS security context which is indicated by an ngKSI can be taken into use to establish the secure exchange of NAS messages when a new N1 NAS signalling connection is established without executing a new primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1 or when the AMF initiates a security mode control procedure. For this purpose the initial NAS messages i.e. REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST SERVICE REQUEST and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an ngKSI in the ngKSI IE indicating the current 5G NAS security context used to integrity protect the NAS message.
In the present document when the UE is required to delete an ngKSI the UE shall set the ngKSI to the value no key is available and consider also the associated keys KAMF or KAMF 5G NAS ciphering key and 5G NAS integrity key invalid i.e. the 5G NAS security context associated with the ngKSI as no longer valid. In the initial registration procedure when the key KAUSF is invalid the UE shall delete the ngKSI.
NOTE In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number might be used instead of the term key set identifier KSI.
As described in subclause 4.8 in order to interwork with EUTRAN connected to EPC the UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode can operate in either singleregistration mode or dualregistration mode. A UE operating in dualregistration mode shall independently maintain and use both EPS security context see 3GPP TS 24.301 and 5G NAS security context. When the UE operating in dualregistration mode performs an EPS attach procedure it shall take into use an EPS security context and follow the handling of this security context as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 . However when the UE operating in dualregistration mode performs an initial registration procedure it shall take into use a 5G NAS security context and follow the handling of this security context as described in the present specification.
The UE and the AMF need to be able to maintain two 5G NAS security contexts simultaneously i.e. a current 5G NAS security context and a noncurrent 5G NAS security context since
a after a 5G reauthentication the UE and the AMF can have both a current 5G NAS security context and a noncurrent 5G NAS security context which has not yet been taken into use i.e. a partial native 5G NAS security context and
b after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE and the AMF can have both a mapped 5G NAS security context which is the current 5G NAS security context and a noncurrent native 5G NAS security context that was created during a previous access in N1 mode.
The number of 5G NAS security contexts that need to be maintained simultaneously by the UE and the AMF is limited by the following requirements
a after a successful 5G reauthentication which creates a new partial native 5G NAS security context the AMF and the UE shall delete the noncurrent 5G NAS security context if any
b when a partial native 5G NAS security context is taken into use through a security mode control procedure the AMF shall delete the previously current 5G NAS security context. If the UE does not support multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration see 3GPP TS 31.102 the UE shall delete the previously current 5G NAS security context. If the UE supports multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration the UE shall
1 replace the previously current 5G NAS security context stored in the first 5G security context of that access see 3GPP TS 31.102 with the new 5G security context taken into use through a security mode control procedure when the UE activates the new 5G security context for the same PLMN and access
1a replace the previously current 5G NAS security context stored in the first 5G security context of that access see 3GPP TS 31.102 with the new 5G security context taken into use through a security mode control procedure when the UE activates the new 5G security context for a different PLMN over that access but the previously current 5G NAS security context is not associated with the 5GGUTI of the other access or
2 store the previously current 5G NAS security context in the second 5G security context of that access see 3GPP TS 31.102 and store the new 5G security context taken into use through a security mode control procedure in the first 5G security context when the UE activates the new 5G security context for a different PLMN over that access but the previously current 5G NAS security context is associated with the 5GGUTI of the other access
c when the AMF and the UE create a 5G NAS security context using null integrity protection algorithm and null ciphering algorithm during an initial registration procedure for emergency services or a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update for a UE that has an emergency PDU session see subclause 5.4.2.2 the AMF and the UE shall delete the previous current 5G NAS security context. The UE shall not update the USIM and nonvolatile ME memory with the current 5G NAS security context and shall delete the current 5G NAS security context when the UE is deregistered from emergency services e.g. before registering for normal service
d when a new mapped 5G NAS security context or 5G NAS security context created using null integrity protection algorithm and null ciphering algorithm is taken into use during the intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the AMF and the UE shall not delete the previously current native 5G NAS security context if any. Instead the previously current native 5G NAS security context shall become a noncurrent native 5G NAS security context and the AMF and the UE shall delete any partial native 5G NAS security context
If no previously current native 5G NAS security context exists the AMF and the UE shall not delete the partial native 5G NAS security context if any
e when the AMF and the UE derive a new mapped 5G NAS security context during intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the AMF and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped 5G NAS security context
f when a noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context is taken into use by a security mode control procedure then the AMF and the UE shall delete the previously current mapped 5G NAS security context
g when the UE or the AMF moves from 5GMMREGISTERED to 5GMMDEREGISTERED state if the current 5G NAS security context is a mapped 5G NAS security context and a noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context exists then the noncurrent 5G NAS security context shall become the current 5G NAS security context. Furthermore the UE and the AMF shall delete any mapped 5G NAS security context or partial native 5G NAS security context.
h when the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface performs an intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode
1 if the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context and the intersystem change is performed in
i 5GMMIDLE mode the UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context after the successful completion of the tracking area update procedure or attach procedure see 3GPP TS 24.301 or
ii 5GMMCONNECTED mode the UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context after the completion of the intersystem change.
After deletion of the mapped 5G NAS security context if the UE has a noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context then the noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context shall become the current full native 5G NAS security context and
i when the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface performs an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMIDLE mode if the UE has a noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context then the UE shall make the noncurrent full native 5G NAS security context as the current native 5G NAS security context. The UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context if any.
###### 4.4.2.1.2	UE leaving state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED
If the UE is capable of registration over a single access only the UE shall mark the 5G NAS security context on the USIM or in the nonvolatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an initial registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2 or when the UE leaves state 5GMMDEREGISTERED for any other state except 5GMMNULL.
If the UE is capable of registration over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and was last registered on the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and the non3GPP access the UE in the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access shall mark the 5G NAS security contexts in record 1 of the 3GPP access and the non3GPP access on the USIM or in the nonvolatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an initial registration procedure over either 3GPP access or non3GPP access as described in subclause 5.5.1.2 or when the UE leaves state 5GMMDEREGISTERED for any other state except 5GMMNULL over either 3GPP access or non3GPP access.
###### 4.4.2.1.3	UE entering state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED
If the UE is capable of registration over a single access only the UE shall store the current native 5G NAS security context on the USIM or in the nonvolatile memory and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED from any other state except 5GMMNULL or when the UE aborts the initial registration procedure without having left 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
If the UE is capable of registration over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and is registered on the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and the non3GPP access the UE shall store the current native 5G NAS security contexts of the 3GPP access and the non3GPP access as specified in annex C and mark them as valid only when the UE enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED from any other state except 5GMMNULL over both the 3GPP access and non3GPP access or only when the UE aborts the initial registration procedure without having left 5GMMDEREGISTERED over both the 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
##### 4.4.2.2	Establishment of a mapped 5G NAS security context during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
In order for the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface to derive a mapped 5G NAS security context for an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF shall construct a mapped 5G NAS security context from the EPS security context received from the source MME as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AMF shall select the 5G NAS security algorithms and derive the 5G NAS keys i.e. KNASenc and KNASint. The AMF shall define an ngKSI for the newly derived KAMF key such that the value field is taken from the eKSI of the KASME key and the type field is set to indicate a mapped security context and associate this ngKSI with the newly created mapped 5G NAS security context. The AMF shall then include the message authentication code selected NAS algorithms NCC and generated ngKSI in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE see subclause 9.11.2.9.
When the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface receives the command to perform intersystem change to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the UE shall derive a mapped KAMF as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 using the KASME from the EPS security context. Furthermore the UE shall also derive the 5G NAS keys from the mapped KAMF using the selected NAS algorithm identifiers included in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and associate this mapped 5G NAS security context with the ngKSI value received. The UE shall then verify the received NAS MAC. In case the received NAS MAC is not verified successfully see subclause 4.4.3.3 the UE shall discard the content of the received S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and inform the lower layers that the received S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container is invalid.
When the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services and has no current EPS security context the AMF shall set 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected 5G NAS security algorithms in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE. The AMF shall create a locally generated KAMF. The AMF shall set the ngKSI value of the associated security context to 000 and the type of security context flag to mapped security context in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
When the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface receives the command to perform intersystem change to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode see 3GPP TS 38.331 and has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services if 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected 5G NAS security algorithms are included in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE the UE shall create a locally generated KAMF. Furthermore the UE shall set the ngKSI value of the associated security context to the KSI value received.
After the new mapped 5G NAS security context is taken into use for the 3GPP access following a successful inter system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non3GPP access
a if a native 5G NAS security context is used on the non3GPP access and
1 the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access then the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new mapped 5G NAS security context on the 3GPP access for the non3GPP access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively. The UE and AMF shall keep the native 5G NAS security context which was used on the non3GPP access and make it a noncurrent native 5G NAS security context. The noncurrent native 5G NAS security context may be reactivated later using the security mode control procedure or
2 the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access in order to activate the native 5G NAS security context over the 3GPP access that is active on the non3GPP access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the 3GPP access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the native 5G NAS security context that is used on the non3GPP access or
b if a mapped 5G NAS security context is used on the non3GPP access and
1 the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new mapped 5G NAS security context active on the 3GPP access for the non3GPP access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively or
2 the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access in order to activate the same mapped 5G NAS security context over one access that is used on the other access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over oneaccess as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the mapped 5G NAS security context that is used over the other access.
If the intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode is not completed successfully the AMF and the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface shall delete the new mapped 5G NAS security context.
##### 4.4.2.3	Establishment of a 5G NAS security context during N1 mode to N1 mode handover
During an N1 mode to N1 mode handover the target AMF may derive a new 5G NAS security context for which the target AMF creates a new 5G NAS security context as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
When a new 5G NAS security context is derived using the same KAMF the target AMF includes the 8 least significant bits of the downlink NAS COUNT in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and indicates that a new KAMF shall not be derived see subclause 9.11.2.6. The AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after creating the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
When a new 5G NAS security context is created from a new KAMF the target AMF includes the 8 least significant bits of the downlink NAS COUNT in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and indicates that a new KAMF shall be derived see subclause 9.11.2.6. The AMF shall then set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero. The AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after creating the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
The target AMF also includes the ngKSI with the same value as the ngKSI currently being used with the UE the message authentication code and the selected NAS algorithms in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
When the UE receives a command to perform handover to NGRAN including an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE see subclause 9.11.2.6 the UE derives a new 5G NAS security context as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . When the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE indicates that a new KAMF needs to be derived the UE shall set both the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero after creating the new 5G NAS security context.
If the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE does not have a valid NAS COUNT see subclause 4.4.3.2 or the received NAS MAC is not verified successfully see subclause 4.4.3.3 the UE shall discard the content of the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE continue to use the current 5G NAS security context and inform the lower layers that the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container is invalid.
NOTE 1 During N1 mode to N1 mode handover the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE see subclause 9.11.2.6 is equivalent to sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE in order to derive and use a new 5G NAS security context optionally created with a new KAMF. The UE maintains the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms until the UE receives a new Selected EPS NAS security algorithms.
After the new 5G NAS security context is taken into use for 3GPP access following a successful N1 mode to N1 mode handover and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non3GPP access
a the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new 5G NAS security context over the non3GPP access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively. If the new 5G NAS security context is created from a new KAMF the AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero also for the non3GPP access otherwise the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT for the non3GPP access are not changed or
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access in order to activate the new 5G NAS security context over the non3GPP access that has been activated for the 3GPP access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non3GPP access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the new 5G NAS security context that was activated over the 3GPP access and shall include the horizontal derivation parameter indicating KAMF derivation is not required. Otherwise if the new 5G NAS security context is created from a new KAMF the AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for the non3GPP access.
NOTE 2 Explicit indication KAMF derivation is not required for the non3GPP access is to align security contexts within the UE without a subsequent derivation of a new KAMF in the non3GPP access.
##### 4.4.2.4	Establishment of an EPS security context during inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
In order for the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface to derive a mapped EPS security context for an intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF shall prepare a mapped EPS security context for the target MME as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The AMF shall derive a KASME using the KAMF key and the downlink NAS COUNT of the current 5G NAS security context include the corresponding NAS sequence number in the N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE see subclause 9.11.2.7 and then increments its stored downlink NAS COUNT value by one.
NOTE The creation of the N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container and the increment of the stored downlink NAS COUNT value by one are performed in prior to transferring the mapped EPS security context to the MME.
The AMF shall select the NAS algorithms identifiers to be used in the target MME after the intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode for encryption and integrity protection. The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT associated with the newly derived KASME key are set to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT value of the current 5G NAS security context respectively. The eKSI for the newly derived KASME key shall be defined such as the value field is taken from the ngKSI and the type field is set to indicate a mapped security context.
When the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface receives a command to perform intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the UE shall derive the mapped EPS security context i.e. derive KASME from KAMF using a downlink NAS COUNT based on the NAS sequence number received in the N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE see subclause 9.11.2.7 as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The UE shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values associated with the newly derived KASME key to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values of the current 5G NAS security context respectively. The eKSI for the newly derived KASME key is defined such that the value field is taken from the ngKSI and the type field is set to indicate a mapped security context. The UE shall also derive the NAS keys as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 23A using the EPS NAS security algorithms identifiers that are stored in the UEs 5G NAS security context.
If the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE does not have a valid NAS COUNT see subclause 4.4.3.2 the UE shall discard the content of the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE and inform the lower layers that the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container is invalid.
If the intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode is not completed successfully the AMF and the UE shall delete the new mapped EPS security context.
##### 4.4.2.5	Establishment of secure exchange of NAS messages
Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is usually established by the AMF during the registration procedure by initiating a security mode control procedure. After successful completion of the security mode control procedure all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the current 5G security algorithms and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5 all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the current 5G security algorithms.
During intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the AMF and the UE by
a the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the AMF to the UE triggering the intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode see 3GPP TS 33.501 . The UE uses these parameters to generate the mapped 5G NAS security context see subclause 8.6.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 and
b after the intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the transmission of a REGISTRATION REQUEST message from the UE to the AMF. The UE shall send this message integrity protected using the mapped 5G NAS security context and further protect this message as specified in subclause 4.4.6 and subclause 5.5.1.3.2. After the AMF receives the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
1 if the AMF decides to take the native 5G NAS security context into use the security mode control procedure is performed. From this time onward all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the native 5G NAS security context and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5 all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the native 5G NAS security context or
2 if the AMF decides to take the mapped 5G NAS security context into use from this time onward all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the mapped 5G NAS security context and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5 all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the mapped 5G NAS security context.
During intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMIDLE mode if the UE is operating in singleregistration mode and
a if the UE has a valid native 5G NAS security context the UE shall transmit a REGISTRATION REQUEST message integrity protected with the native 5G NAS security context. The UE shall include the ngKSI indicating the native 5G NAS security context value in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
After receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the ngKSI indicating a native 5G NAS security context value the AMF shall check whether the ngKSI included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message belongs to a 5G NAS security context available in the AMF and shall verify the MAC of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the verification is successful the AMF deletes the EPS security context received from the source MME if any and the AMF reestablishes the secure exchange of NAS messages by either
1 replying with a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message that is integrity protected and ciphered using the native 5G NAS security context. From this time onward all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5 all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered or
2 initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the AMF to take a noncurrent 5G NAS security context into use or to modify the current 5G NAS security context by selecting new NAS security algorithms.
b if the UE has no valid native 5G NAS security context the UE shall send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity protection and encryption.
After receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity protection and encryption
1 if N26 interface is supported
i if an EPS security context received from the source MME does not include the NAS security algorithms set to EIA0 and EEA0 the AMF shall either create a fresh mapped 5G NAS security context see subclause 8.6.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 or trigger a primary authentication and key agreement procedure to create a fresh native 5G NAS security context or
ii if an EPS security context received from the source MME includes the NAS security algorithms set to EIA0 and EEA0 the AMF shall trigger a primary authentication and key agreement procedure to create a fresh native 5G NAS security context or
2 if N26 interface is not supported the AMF shall trigger a primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The newly created 5G NAS security context is taken into use by initiating a security mode control procedure and this context becomes the current 5G NAS security context in both the UE and the AMF. This reestablishes the secure exchange of NAS messages.
During an N1 mode to N1 mode handover secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the AMF and the UE by
the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the target AMF to the UE triggering the N1 mode to N1 mode handover see 3GPP TS 33.501 . The UE uses these parameters to create a new 5G NAS security context.
The secure exchange of NAS messages shall be continued after N1 mode to N1 mode handover. It is terminated after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode or when the NAS signalling connection is released.
When a UE in 5GMMIDLE mode establishes a new NAS signalling connection and has a valid current 5G NAS security context the UE shall transmit the initial NAS message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security context and further protect this message as specified in subclause 4.4.6. The UE shall include the ngKSI indicating the current 5G NAS security context value in the initial NAS message. The AMF shall check whether the ngKSI included in the initial NAS message belongs to a 5G NAS security context available in the AMF and shall verify the MAC of the NAS message. If the verification is successful the AMF may reestablish the secure exchange of NAS messages
a by replying with a NAS message that is integrity protected and ciphered using the current 5G NAS security context. From this time onward all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause 4.4.5 all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered or
b by initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the AMF to take a noncurrent 5G NAS security context into use or to modify the current 5G NAS security context by selecting new NAS security algorithms.
When a UE attempts multiple registrations in the same or different serving network both the AMF and the UE shall follow the behavior specified in subclause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 . The UE may support multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration see 3GPP TS 31.102 . If the UE supports multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration the UE can select the appropriate one among the stored 5G security contexts to protect the initial NAS message see 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE For the case when the UE has two records of NAS security context stored and is attempting registration to the PLMN associated with the 5GGUTI or an equivalent PLMN for that access the UE uses the first NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message. For the case when the UE has two records of NAS security context stored and is attempting registration to the PLMN associated with the second record or an equivalent PLMN of that access the UE uses the second NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message. For other cases when the UE has two records of NAS security context stored and is attempting registration to a PLMN which is not associated with any NAS security context record the UE uses either record of the NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message.
##### 4.4.2.6	Change of security keys
When the AMF initiates a reauthentication to create a new 5G NAS security context the messages exchanged during the authentication procedure are integrity protected and ciphered using the current 5G NAS security context if any.
Both UE and AMF shall continue to use the current 5G NAS security context until the AMF initiates a security mode control procedure. The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message sent by the AMF includes the ngKSI of the new 5G NAS security context to be used. The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message integrity protected with the new 5G NAS security context but unciphered. When the UE responds with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the new 5G NAS security context.
The AMF can also modify the current 5G NAS security context or take the noncurrent native 5G NAS security context if any into use by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including the ngKSI of the 5G NAS security context to be modified and including a new set of selected NAS security algorithms. In this case the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message integrity protected with the modified 5G NAS security context but unciphered. When the UE replies with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the modified 5G NAS security context.
##### 4.4.3.1	General
Each 5G NAS security context shall be associated with two separate counters NAS COUNT per access type in the same PLMN one related to uplink NAS messages and one related to downlink NAS messages. If the 5G NAS security context is used for access via both 3GPP and non3GPP access in the same PLMN there are two NAS COUNT counter pairs associated with the 5G NAS security context. The NAS COUNT counters use 24bit internal representation and are independently maintained by UE and AMF. The NAS COUNT shall be constructed as a NAS sequence number 8 least significant bits concatenated with a NAS overflow counter 16 most significant bits.
When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it shall be considered to be a 32bit entity which shall be constructed by padding the 24bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most significant bits.
The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or nonvolatile memory as described in annex C is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message.
The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or nonvolatile memory as described in annex C is the largest downlink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message.
The value of the uplink NAS COUNT stored in the AMF is the largest uplink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message.
The value of the downlink NAS COUNT stored in the AMF is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message.
The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between the UE and the AMF as part of the NAS signalling. After each new or retransmitted outbound SECURITY PROTECTED 5GS NAS MESSAGE message the sender shall increase the NAS COUNT number by one except for the initial NAS messages if the lower layers indicated the failure to establish the RRC connection see 3GPP TS 38.331 . Specifically on the sender side the NAS sequence number shall be increased by one and if the result is zero due to wrap around the stored NAS overflow counter shall also be incremented by one see subclause 4.4.3.5. If through implementationdependent means the receiver determines that the NAS message is a replay of an earlier NAS message then the receiver handles the received NAS message as described in subclause 4.4.3.2. Otherwise in order to determine the estimated NAS COUNT value to be used for integrity verification of a received NAS message
The sequence number part of the estimated NAS COUNT value shall be equal to the sequence number in the received NAS message and
If the receiver can guarantee that this NAS message was not previously accepted then the receiver may select the estimated NAS overflow counter so that the estimated NAS COUNT value is lower than the stored NAS COUNT value otherwise the receiver selects the estimated NAS overflow counter so that the estimated NAS COUNT value is higher than the stored NAS COUNT value.
During the intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode when a mapped 5G NAS security context is derived and taken into use the AMF shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero. The UE shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero.
During the intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after it has created an S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container see subclause 9.11.2.9.
During the intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after it has created an N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container see subclause 9.11.2.7.
During N1 mode to N1 mode handover
a if the new 5G NAS security context is created with the same KAMF the AMF shall signal the 8 least significant bits of the current downlink NAS COUNT value in an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container see subclause 9.11.2.6. The AMF shall then increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one or
b if the new 5G NAS security context is created with a new KAMF the AMF shall signal the 8 least significant bits of the current downlink NAS COUNT value in an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container see subclause 9.11.2.6 and shall then set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero. The AMF shall then increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one. The UE shall also set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters to zero.
NOTE During the intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container see subclause 9.11.2.9 is treated as an implicit SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for the UE and the AMF and therefore the AMF regards the sending of the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container as the sending of an initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in order to derive and take into use a mapped 5G NAS security context for the purpose of the NAS COUNT handling.
##### 4.4.3.2	Replay protection
Replay protection shall be supported for received NAS messages both in the AMF and the UE. However since the realization of replay protection does not affect the interoperability between nodes no specific mechanism is required for implementation.
Replay protection assures that one and the same NAS message is not accepted twice by the receiver. Specifically for a given 5G NAS security context a given NAS COUNT value shall be accepted at most one time and only if message integrity verifies correctly.
Replay protection is not applicable when 5GIA0 is used.
##### 4.4.3.3	Integrity protection and verification
The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the integrity protection algorithm.
The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in subclause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the integrity verification algorithm.
The algorithm to calculate the integrity protection information is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 and in case of the
a SECURITY PROTECTED 5GS NAS MESSAGE message the integrity protection shall include octet 7 to n i.e. the Sequence number IE and the NAS message IE.
b Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE the integrity protection shall include all octets of the value part of the IE starting from octet 7.
NOTE To ensure backward compatibility the UE uses all octets starting from octet 7 in the received NAS transparent container for the purpose of integrity check of the NAS transparent container irrespective of the releaseversion it supports. After a successful integrity check the UE can ignore the octets which are not specified in the releaseversion which the UE supports.
In addition to the data that is to be integrity protected the BEARER ID DIRECTION bit NAS COUNT and 5G NAS integrity key are input to the integrity protection algorithm. These parameters are described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
After successful integrity protection validation the receiver shall update its corresponding locally stored NAS COUNT with the value of the estimated NAS COUNT for this NAS message.
Integrity verification is not applicable when 5GIA0 is used.
##### 4.4.3.4	Ciphering and deciphering
The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the ciphering algorithm.
The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in subclause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the deciphering algorithm.
The input parameters to the NAS ciphering algorithm are the BEARER ID DIRECTION bit NAS COUNT NAS encryption key and the length of the key stream to be generated by the encryption algorithm.
When applying initial NAS message protection to the REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as described in subclause 4.4.6 the length of the key stream is set to the length of the entire plain NAS message that is included in the NAS message container IE i.e. the value part of the NAS message container IE that is to be ciphered.
When applying initial NAS message protection to the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as described in subclause 4.4.6 the length of the key stream is set to the length of
a the value part of the CIoT small data container IE that is to be ciphered or
b the value part of the NAS message container IE that is to be ciphered.
##### 4.4.3.5	NAS COUNT wrap around
If when increasing the NAS COUNT as specified above the AMF detects that either its downlink NAS COUNT or the UEs uplink NAS COUNT is close to wrap around close to 224 the AMF shall take the following actions
If there is no noncurrent native 5G NAS security context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT values the AMF shall initiate a new primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the UE leading to a new established 5G NAS security context and the NAS COUNT being reset to 0 in both the UE and the AMF when the new 5G NAS security context is activated
Otherwise the AMF can activate a noncurrent native 5G NAS security context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT values or initiate a new primary authentication and key agreement procedure as specified above.
If for some reason a new KAMF has not been established using primary authentication and key agreement procedure before the NAS COUNT wraps around the node AMF or UE in need of sending a NAS message shall instead release the NAS signalling connection. Prior to sending the next uplink NAS message the UE shall delete the ngKSI indicating the current 5G NAS security context.
When the 5GIA0 is used as the NAS integrity algorithm the UE and the AMF shall allow NAS COUNT wrap around. If NAS COUNT wrap around occurs the following requirements apply
a the UE and the AMF shall continue to use the current 5G NAS security context
b the AMF shall not initiate the primary authentication and key agreement procedure
c the AMF shall not release the NAS signalling connection and
d the UE shall not perform a local release of the NAS signalling connection.
##### 4.4.4.1	General
For the UE integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the 5GMM NAS messages once a valid 5G NAS security context exists and has been taken into use. For the network integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the 5GMM NAS messages once a secure exchange of 5GS NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection. Integrity protection of all NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS. It is the network which activates integrity protection.
The use of null integrity protection algorithm 5GIA0 see subclause 9.11.3.34 in the current 5G NAS security context is only allowed
a for an unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency services is allowed
b for a WAGF acting on behalf of an FNRG
c for a WAGF acting on behalf of an N5GC device and
d for a 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device.
For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the null integrity protection algorithm or any other integrity protection algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context.
If the null integrity protection algorithm5GIA0 has been selected as an integrity protection algorithm the receiver shall regard the NAS messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as integrity protected.
Details of the integrity protection and verification of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
When a NAS message needs to be sent both ciphered and integrity protected the NAS message is first ciphered and then the ciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC.
NOTE NAS messages that are ciphered with the null ciphering algorithm 5GEA0 are regarded as ciphered see subclause 4.4.5.
When a NAS message needs to be sent only integrity protected and unciphered the unciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC.
When a 5GSM message is piggybacked in a 5GMM message there is only one Sequence number IE and one Message authentication code IE for the 5GMM message piggybacking the 5GSM message.
##### 4.4.4.2	Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the UE
Except the messages listed below no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving 5GMM entity in the UE or forwarded to the 5GSM entity unless the network has established secure exchange of 5GS NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection
a IDENTITY REQUEST if requested identification parameter is SUCI
b AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
c AUTHENTICATION RESULT
d AUTHENTICATION REJECT
e REGISTRATION REJECT if the 5GMM cause is not #76 #78 #81 or #82
f DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT for non switch off and
g SERVICE REJECT if the 5GMM cause is not #76 or #78.
NOTE These messages are accepted by the UE without integrity protection as in certain situations they are sent by the network before security can be activated.
Integrity protection is never applied directly to 5GSM messages but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included.
Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established the receiving 5GMM entity in the UE shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS. If NAS signalling messages having not successfully passed the integrity check are received then the NAS in the UE shall discard that message. The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has not successfully passed the integrity check is specified in subclause 5.4.2.5. If any NAS signalling message is received as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established by the network then the NAS shall discard this message.
##### 4.4.4.3	Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the AMF
Except the messages listed below no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF or forwarded to the 5GSM entity unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection
a REGISTRATION REQUEST
b IDENTITY RESPONSE if requested identification parameter is SUCI
c AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
d AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
e SECURITY MODE REJECT
f DEREGISTRATION REQUEST and
g DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT
NOTE 1 The REGISTRATION REQUEST message is sent by the UE without integrity protection if the registration procedure is initiated due to an intersystem change in 5GMMIDLE mode and no current 5G NAS security context is available in the UE. The other messages are accepted by the AMF without integrity protection as in certain situations they are sent by the UE before security can be activated.
NOTE 2 The DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without integrity protection e.g. if the UE is registered for emergency services and there is no valid 5G NAS security context available or if due to user interaction a registration procedure is cancelled before the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established. For these cases the network can attempt to use additional criteria e.g. whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic registration update or still responding to paging before marking the UE as 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
Integrity protection is never applied directly to 5GSM messages but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included.
Once a current 5G NAS security context exists until the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF shall process the following NAS signalling messages even if the MAC included in the message fails the integrity check or cannot be verified as the 5G NAS security context is not available in the network
a REGISTRATION REQUEST
b IDENTITY RESPONSE if requested identification parameter is SUCI
c AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
d AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
e SECURITY MODE REJECT
f DEREGISTRATION REQUEST
g DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT
h SERVICE REQUEST and
i CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
NOTE 3 These messages are processed by the AMF even when the MAC that fails the integrity check or cannot be verified as in certain situations they can be sent by the UE protected with a 5G NAS security context that is no longer available in the network.
If a REGISTRATION REQUEST message for initial registration fails the integrity check and it is not a registration request for emergency services the AMF shall authenticate the subscriber before processing the registration request any further. Additionally the AMF shall initiate a security mode control procedure and include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2. If authentication procedure is not successful the AMF shall maintain if any the 5GMMcontext and 5G NAS security context unchanged.For the case when the registration procedure is for emergency services see subclause 5.5.1.2.3 and subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If a REGISTRATION REQUEST message for mobility and periodic registration update fails the integrity check and the UE provided EPS NAS message container IE which was successfully verified by the source MME the AMF may create a mapped 5G NAS security context and initiate a security mode control procedure to take the new mapped 5G NAS security context into use otherwise if the UE has only a nonemergency PDU session established the AMF shall initiate a primary authentication and key agreement procedure to create a new native 5G NAS security context. Additionally the AMF shall initiate a security mode control procedure and include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2. If authentication procedure is not successful the AMF shall maintain if any the 5GMMcontext and 5G NAS security context unchanged. For the case when the UE has an emergency PDU session see subclause 5.5.1.3.3 and subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message fails the integrity check the AMF shall proceed as follows
If it is not a deregistration request due to switch off and the AMF can initiate an authentication procedure the AMF should authenticate the subscriber before processing the deregistration request any further.
If it is a deregistration request due to switch off or the AMF does not initiate an authentication procedure for any other reason the AMF may ignore the deregistration request and remain in state 5GMMREGISTERED.
NOTE 4 The network can attempt to use additional criteria e.g. whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic registration update or still responding to paging before marking the UE as 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
If a SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message fails the integrity check and the UE has only nonemergency PDU sessions established the AMF shall send the SERVICE REJECT message with 5GMM cause #9 UE identity cannot be derived by the network and keep the 5GMMcontext and 5G NAS security context unchanged. For the case when the UE has an emergency PDU session and integrity check fails the AMF may skip the authentication procedure even if no 5G NAS security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.2. Additionally the AMF shall include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2. After successful completion of the service request procedure the network shall perform a local release of all nonemergency PDU sessions. The emergency PDU session shall not be released.
Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS. If any NAS signalling message having not successfully passed the integrity check is received then the NAS in the AMF shall discard that message. If any NAS signalling message is received as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established then the NAS shall discard this message.
#### 4.4.5	Ciphering of NAS signalling messages
The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option subject to AMF configuration. When operation of the network without ciphering is configured the AMF shall indicate the use of null ciphering algorithm 5GEA0 see subclause 9.11.3.34 in the current 5G NAS security context for all UEs. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the null ciphering algorithm or any other ciphering algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context.
When the UE establishes a new N1 NAS signalling connection it shall apply security protection to the initial NAS message as described in subclause 4.4.6.
The UE shall start the ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages when the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for an N1 NAS signalling connection. From this time onward unless explicitly defined the UE shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released or the UE performs intersystem change to S1 mode.
The AMF shall start ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages as described in subclause 4.4.2.5. From this time onward except for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message the AMF shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released or the UE performs intersystem change to S1 mode.
Ciphering is never applied directly to 5GSM messages but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included.
Once the encryption of NAS messages has been started between the AMF and the UE the receiver shall discard the unciphered NAS messages which shall have been ciphered according to the rules described in this specification.
If the null ciphering algorithm 5GEA0 has been selected as a ciphering algorithm the NAS messages with the security header indicating ciphering are regarded as ciphered.
Details of ciphering and deciphering of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
#### 4.4.6	Protection of initial NAS signalling messages
The 5GS supports protection of initial NAS messages as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The protection of initial NAS messages applies to the REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST SERVICE REQUEST and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and is achieved as follows
a If the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context the UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including cleartext IEs only. After activating a 5G NAS security context resulting from a security mode control procedure
1 if the UE needs to send noncleartext IEs the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message i.e. containing both cleartext IEs and noncleartext IEs in the NAS message container IE and shall include the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or
2 if the UE does not need to send noncleartext IEs the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message i.e. containing cleartext IEs only in the NAS message container IE and shall include the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
b If the UE has a valid 5G NAS security context and
1 the UE needs to send noncleartext IEs in a REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message the UE includes the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message i.e. containing both cleartext IEs and noncleartext IEs in the NAS message container IE and shall cipher the value part of the NAS message container IE. The UE shall then send a REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message containing the cleartext IEs and the NAS message container IE
2 the UE needs to send noncleartext IEs in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
i if CIoT small data container IE is the only noncleartext IE to be sent the UE shall cipher the value part of the CIoT small data container IE. The UE shall then send a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message containing the cleartext IEs and the CIoT small data container IE
ii otherwise the UE includes noncleartext IEs in the NAS message container IE and shall cipher the value part of the NAS message container IE. The UE shall then send a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message containing the cleartext IEs and the NAS message container IE
3 the UE does not need to send noncleartext IEs in a REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message the UE sends the REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message without including the NAS message container IE or
4 the UE does not need to send noncleartext IEs in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message the UE sends the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message without including the NAS message container IE and the CIoT small data container IE.
When the initial NAS message is a REGISTRATION REQUEST message the cleartext IEs are
Extended protocol discriminator
Security header type
Spare half octet
Registration request message identity
5GS registration type
ngKSI
5GS mobile identity
UE security capability
Additional GUTI
UE status
EPS NAS message container
NID and
UE determined PLMN with disaster condition.
When the initial NAS message is a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message the cleartext IEs are
Extended protocol discriminator
Security header type
Spare half octet
Deregistration request message identity
Deregistration type
ngKSI and
5GS mobile identity.
When the initial NAS message is a SERVICE REQUEST message the cleartext IEs are
Extended protocol discriminator
Security header type
Spare half octet
ngKSI
Service request message identity
Service type and
5GSTMSI.
When the initial NAS message is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message the cleartext IEs are
Extended protocol discriminator
Security header type
Spare half octet
ngKSI
Control plane service request message identity and
Control plane service type.
When the UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message that includes a NAS message container IE the UE shall set the security header type of the initial NAS message to integrity protected.
When the AMF receives an integrity protected initial NAS message which includes a NAS message container IE the AMF shall decipher the value part of the NAS message container IE. If the received initial NAS message is a REGISTRATION REQUEST DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or a SERVICE REQUEST message the AMF shall consider the NAS message that is obtained from the NAS message container IE as the initial NAS message that triggered the procedure.
When the AMF receives a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message which includes a CIoT small data container IE the AMF shall decipher the value part of the CIoT small data container IE and handle the message as specified in subclause 5.6.1.4.2.
If the UE
a has 5GEA0 as a selected 5G NAS security algorithm and
b selects a PLMN other than Registered PLMN and EPLMN over one access
the UE shall send an initial NAS message including cleartext IEs only via the access type associated with the newly selected PLMN as described in this subclause for the case when the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context.
If the UE
a has 5GEA0 as a selected 5G NAS security algorithm and
b selects a PLMN other than Registered PLMN and EPLMN over one access and the Registered PLMN or EPLMN is not registering or registered over other access
the UE shall delete the 5G NAS security context.
NOTE UE deletes the 5G NAS security context only if the UE is not in the connected mode.
#### 4.4.7	Protection of NAS IEs
The network can provide the SOR transparent container IE during the registration procedure to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The SOR transparent container IE is integrity protected by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The UE can provide the SOR transparent container IE during the registration procedure to the network in the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message. The SoRMACIUE in the SOR transparent container IE is generated by the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The network can provide the Payload container IE during the Networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to the UE in DL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the Payload container type IE is set to SOR transparent container or UE parameters update transparent container the Payload container IE is integrity protected by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . If the Payload container type IE is set to Multiple payloads and the payload container type field of the payload container entry is set to SOR transparent container or UE parameters update transparent container the payload container entry contents field of the payload container entry is integrity protected correspondingly.
The UE can provide the Payload container IE during the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure to the network in UL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the Payload container type IE is set to SOR transparent container or UE parameters update transparent container the SoRMACIUE or UPUMACIUE in the Payload container IE is generated by the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . If the Payload container type IE is set to Multiple payloads and the payload container type field of the payload container entry is set to SOR transparent container or UE parameters update transparent container the SoRMACIUE or UPUMACIUE in the payload container entry contents field of the payload container entry is generated by the UE correspondingly.
#### 4.5.1	General
When the UE needs to access the 5GS the UE not operating as an IABnode see 3GPP TS 23.501 not acting as a 5G ProSe layer2 UEtonetwork relay UE see 3GPP TS 23.304 6E whose access attempt is triggered by a 5G ProSe layer2 remote UE and not acting as an NCRMT node see 3GPP TS 38.300 first performs access control checks to determine if the access is allowed. Access control checks shall be performed for the access attempts defined by the following list of events
NOTE 1 Although the UE operating as an IABnode or as an NCRMT node skips the access control checks the UE operating as an IABnode or as an NCRMT node determines an access category and one or more access identities for each access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause. In this case the NAS provides the RRC establishment cause but does not provide the access category and the one or more access identities to the lower layers.
NOTE 1A Although the UE acting as a 5G ProSe layer2 UEtonetwork relay UE skips the access control checks the UE determines an access category and one or more access identities for each access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
a the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication over 3GPP access and an event that requires a transition to 5GMMCONNECTED mode occurs and
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication and one of the following events occurs
1 5GMM receives an MOIMSregistrationrelatedsignallingstarted indication an MOMMTELvoicecallstarted indication an MOMMTELvideocallstarted indication or an MOSMSoIPattemptstarted indication from upper layers
2 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS unless the request triggered a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode
3 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session establishment unless the request triggered a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode
4 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of UErequested PDU session modification procedure unless the request triggered a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode
5 5GMM receives a request to reestablish the userplane resources for an existing PDU session
6 5GMM is notified that an uplink user data packet is to be sent for a PDU session with suspended userplane resources
7 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send a mobile originated location request unless the request triggered a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode
8 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to send a mobile originated signalling transaction towards the PCF by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT message including a UE policy container see 3GPP TS 24.587 19B and 3GPP TS 24.554 19E unless the request triggered a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode and
9 5GMM receives an indication from lower layers of the RAN timing synchronization status change and decides to transition the UE from 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode as specified in subclause 5.3.1.4.
NOTE 2 5GMM specific procedures initiated by NAS in 5GMMCONNECTED mode or 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication are not subject to access control e.g. a registration procedure after PS handover will not be prevented by access control see subclause 5.5.
NOTE 3 LPP messages SLPP messages or location event report messages transported in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message sent in response to a mobile terminating or network induced location request and the corresponding access attempts are handled as MT access.
NOTE 4 Initiating a mobile originated signalling transaction towards the UDM by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT message including an SOR transparent container is not supported. Therefore access control for these cases has not been specified.
When the NAS detects one of the above events the NAS needs to perform the mapping of the kind of request to one or more access identities and one access category and lower layers will perform access barring checks for that request based on the determined access identities and access category.
NOTE 5 The NAS is aware of the above events through indications provided by upper layers or through determining the need to start 5GMM procedures through normal NAS behaviour or both.
To determine the access identities and the access category for a request the NAS checks the reason for access types of service requested and profile of the UE including UE configurations against a set of access identities and access categories defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 namely
a a set of standardized access identities
b a set of standardized access categories and
c a set of operatordefined access categories if available.
For the purpose of determining the applicable access identities from the set of standardized access identities defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 the NAS shall follow the requirements set out in
a subclause 4.5.2 and the rules and actions defined in table 4.5.2.1 if the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access or
b subclause 4.5.2A and the rules and actions defined in table 4.5.2A.1 if the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access.
In order to enable access barring checks for access attempts identified by lower layers in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication the UE provides the applicable access identities to lower layers.
NOTE 6 When and how the NAS provides the applicable access identities to lower layers is UE implementation specific.
NOTE 7 Although the UE operating as an IABnode or as an NCRMT node skips the access control checks the UE provides the applicable access identities to lower layers for access attempts identified by lower layers in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication.
For the purpose of determining the applicable access category from the set of standardized access categories and operatordefined access categories defined in 3GPP TS 22.261 the NAS shall follow the requirements set out in
a subclause 4.5.2 and the rules and actions defined in table 4.5.2.2 if the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access or
b subclause 4.5.2A and the rules and actions defined in table 4.5.2A.2 if the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access.
#### 4.5.2	Determination of the access identities and access category associated with a request for access for UEs not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access
When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events listed in subclause 4.5.1 the UE shall determine one or more access identities from the set of standardized access identities and one access category from the set of standardized access categories and operatordefined access categories to be associated with that access attempt.
The set of the access identities applicable for the request is determined by the UE in the following way
a for each of the access identities 1 2 3 11 12 13 14 and 15 in table 4.5.2.1 the UE shall check whether the access identity is applicable in the selected PLMN if a new PLMN is selected or otherwise if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN and
b if none of the above access identities is applicable then access identity 0 is applicable.
Table 4.5.2.1 Access identities
The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE or the Priority indicator IE to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and subclause 5.5.1.3.4. Processing of the MPS indicator bit of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is described in subclause 5.4.4.3.
When the UE is neither in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty nor in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present nor in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1 then the UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be valid until the UE receives the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message being set to Access identity 1 valid from the RPLMN or from an equivalent PLMN.
When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country the contents of the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity 1. When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC does not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1 the UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to determine if access identity 1 is valid. When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1 the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE and the Priority indicator IE are not applicable. When the UE is not in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country the contents of the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC are not applicable.
The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE or of the Priority indicator IE to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and subclause 5.5.1.3.4. Processing of the MCS indicator bit of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is described in subclause 5.4.4.3. When the UE is neither in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty nor in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present nor in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2 the UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be valid until the UE receives the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message being set to Access identity 2 valid from the RPLMN or from an equivalent PLMN.
When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country the contents of the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity 2. When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC does not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2 the UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to determine if access identity 2 is valid. When the UE is in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country and the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2 the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE and the Priority indicator IE is not applicable. When the UE is not in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or in a visited PLMN of the home country the contents of the USIM file EFUAC\_AIC are not applicable.
The UE checks the conditions specified in subclause 4.4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.122 to determine if access identity 3 is valid and the applicability of access identity 3.
When the UE is in its HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present the contents of the USIM file EFACC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access classes 11 and 15. When the UE is not in its HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or in an EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present access classes 11 and 15 are not applicable.
When the UE is in the HPLMN or in a visited PLMN of the home country the contents of the USIM file EFACC as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access classes 12 14. When the UE is neither in the HPLMN nor in a visited PLMN of the home country access classes 1214 are not applicable.
In order to determine the access category applicable for the access attempt the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2 and use the access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the access attempt matches more than one rule the access category of the lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more than one operatordefined access category definition the UE shall select the access category from the operatordefined access category definition with the lowest precedence value see subclause 4.5.3.
NOTE The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the same time. When multiple events trigger an access attempt at the same time how the access attempt is checked for multiple events is up to UE implementation.
Table 4.5.2.2 Mapping table for access categories
#### 4.5.2A	Determination of the access identities and access category associated with a request for access for UEs operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access
When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events listed in subclause 4.5.1 the UE shall determine one or more access identities from the set of standardized access identities and one access category from the set of standardized access categories and operatordefined access categories to be associated with that access attempt.
The set of the access identities applicable for the request is determined by the UE in the following way
a for each of the access identities 1 2 11 12 13 14 and 15 in table 4.5.2A.1 the UE shall check whether the access identity is applicable in the selected SNPN if a new SNPN is selected or otherwise if it is applicable in the RSNPN or equivalent SNPN and
b if none of the above access identities is applicable then access identity 0 is applicable.
Table 4.5.2A.1 Access identities
The contents of the unified access control configuration in the list of subscriber data stored in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 if an entry of list of subscriber data is selected or in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 if the PLMN subscription is selected and the rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity 1 in the SNPN. When the contents of the unified access control configuration in the list of subscriber data stored in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 if an entry of list of subscriber data is selected or in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 if the PLMN subscription is selected do not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1 for the SNPN the UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the MPS indicator bit of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
The contents of the unified access control configuration in the list of subscriber data stored in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 if an entry of list of subscriber data is selected or in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 if the PLMN subscription is selected and the rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity 2 in the SNPN. When the contents of the unified access control configuration in the list of subscriber data stored in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 if an entry of list of subscriber data is selected or in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 if the PLMN subscription is selected do not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2 for the SNPN the UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
The contents of the unified access control configuration in the list of subscriber data stored in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 if an entry of list of subscriber data is selected or in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 if the PLMN subscription is selected and the rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.
In order to determine the access category applicable for the access attempt the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2 and use the access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the access attempt matches more than one rule the access category of the lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more than one operatordefined access category definition the UE shall select the access category from the operatordefined access category definition with the lowest precedence value see subclause 4.5.3.
NOTE The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the same time. When multiple events trigger an access attempt at the same time how the access attempt is checked for multiple events is up to UE implementation.
Table 4.5.2A.2 Mapping table for access categories
#### 4.5.3	Operator-defined access categories
Operatordefined access category definitions can be signalled to the UE using NAS signalling. Each operatordefined access category definition consists of the following parameters
a a precedence value which indicates in which order the UE shall evaluate the operatordefined category definition for a match
b an operatordefined access category number i.e. access category number in the 3263 range that uniquely identifies the access category in the PLMN or SNPN in which the access categories are being sent to the UE
c criteria consisting of one or more access category criteria type and associated access category criteria type values. The access category criteria type can be set to one of the following
1 DNN
2 Void
3 OS Id + OS App Id of application triggering the access attempt or
4 SNSSAI and
NOTE 1 An access category criteria type can be associated with more than one access category criteria values.
d optionally a standardized access category. This standardized access category is used in combination with the access identities of the UE to determine the RRC establishment cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.
If the access attempt is to establish a new PDU session i.e. it is triggered by
a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session establishment unless the request triggered a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode or
a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session establishment
then
the access attempt matches access category criteria type DNN if the DNN requested by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure matches any of the access criteria type values associated with the access criteria type DNN and
the access attempt matches access category criteria type SNSSAI if the SNSSAI requested by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure matches any of the access criteria type values associated with the access criteria type SNSSAI.
If the access attempt is for an existing PDU session i.e. it is triggered by
a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session modification unless the request triggered a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode
a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session modification
a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE to transition the UE from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for the purpose of PDU session release
a service request procedure or a registration procedure if the UE is in state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE requesting userplane resources for a PDU session or
an uplink user data packet is to be sent for a PDU session with suspended userplane resources
then
the access attempt matches access category criteria type DNN if the DNN provided by the network in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message matches any of the access criteria type values associated with the access criteria type DNN and
the access attempt matches access category criteria type SNSSAI if the SNSSAI associated with the PDU session matches any of the access criteria type values associated with the access criteria type SNSSAI.
NOTE 2 In order to avoid having access attempts for nonalwayson PDU sessions blocked due to access barring of alwayson PDU sessions it is recommended that the network assigns the highest precedence values to operatordefined access category definition which can be matched by alwayson PDU sessions.
An access attempt matches the criteria of an operatordefined access category definition if the access attempt matches all access category criteria types included in the criteria with any of the associated access criteria type values.
Each operatordefined access category definition has a different precedence value.
Several operatordefined access category definitions can have the same operatordefined access category number.
If
an access category in bullet d is not provided
an access category in bullet d is provided and is not a standardized access category or
an access category in bullet d is provided is a standardized access category and is not recognized by the UE
the UE shall use instead access category 7 MO\_data in combination with the access identities of the UE to determine the RRC establishment cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.
The operatordefined access category definitions are valid in the PLMN which provided them and in a PLMN equivalent to the PLMN which provided them or in the SNPN which provided them and in an SNPN equivalent to the SNPN which provided them as specified in annex C.
If the UE stores operatordefined access category definitions valid in the selected PLMN or the RPLMN or valid in the selected SNPN or RSNPN then access control in 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication will only be performed for the event a defined in subclause 4.5.1. If the transition from 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication over 3GPP access to 5GMMCONNECTED mode is due to a UE NAS initiated 5GMM specific procedure then this access attempt shall be mapped to one of the standardized access categories in the range &lt 32 see subclause 4.5.2. I.e. for this case the UE shall skip the checking of operatordefined access category definitions.
If the UE stores operatordefined access category definitions valid in the selected PLMN or the RPLMN or valid in the selected SNPN or RSNPN then access control in 5GMMCONNECTED mode and in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication will only be performed for the events 1 to 8 defined in subclause 4.5.1.
The UE shall handle the operatordefined access category definitions stored for the RPLMN or RSNPN as specified in subclause 5.4.4.3 subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and subclause 5.5.1.3.4.
When the UE is switched off the UE shall keep the operatordefined access category definitions so that the operatordefined access category definitions can be used after switch on.
When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the previously selected PLMN or selects a new SNPN which is not equivalent to the previously selected SNPN the UE shall stop using the operatordefined access category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN or SNPN and should keep the operatordefined access category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN or SNPN.
NOTE 3 When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the previously selected PLMN or selects a new SNPN which is not equivalent to the previously selected SNPN the UE can delete the operatordefined access category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN or SNPN e.g. if there is no storage space in the UE.

#### 4.5.5	Exception handling and avoiding double barring
Access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid double barring for any service request or registration procedure initiated for the purpose of NAS signalling connection recovery or following a fallback indication from the lower layers see subclauses 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.4.
NOTE 1 The case of NAS signalling connection recovery also includes the cases where the UE was in S1 mode when the RRC connection failure occurred.
For any service request or registration procedure of this kind the UE determines an access category as specified in subclause 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 or 4.5.2A unless a different access category is specified in the rest of the present subclause.
NOTE 2 Although the access control checking is skipped the access category is determined for the specific access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
There are several services or an MO IMS registration related signalling for which the NAS needs to be informed when the service starts and stops
because while the service is ongoing or the MO IMS registration related signalling is ongoing the mapping of other access attempts to a specific access category can be affected and
in order to avoid double barring at the start of these services or at the start of the MO IMS registration related signalling.
These services are
a emergency service
b MMTEL voice
c MMTEL video
d SMSoIP
e SMS over NAS
f 5GCMOLR procedure
g UErequested policy provisioning procedure for V2XP ProSeP or both and
h CIoT user data transfer over the control plane.
The UE considers an emergency service a as started when 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to register for emergency services or to establish a PDU session with request type = initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session. It considers the emergency service as stopped when this PDU session is released.
In addition the UE considers an emergency service a as started when the 5GMM receives a request from the upper layers to perform emergency services fallback and performs emergency services fallback as specified in subclause 4.13.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 . In this case the UE considers the emergency service as stopped when
the emergency PDU session established during the emergency services fallback is released if the UE has moved to an EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN or
the service request procedure involved in the emergency services fallback is completed otherwise.
While an emergency service a is ongoing any access attempt triggered by the initiation of a registration deregistration or service request procedure or by an uplink user data packet to be sent for an emergency PDU session with suspended userplane resources is mapped to access category 2 = emergency.
Once the emergency service has successfully passed access control then as long as the service is ongoing the following access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid double barring
any service request procedure related to the PDU session associated with request type = initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session and
any uplink user data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended userplane resources associated with request type = initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session.
NOTE 3 Although the access control checking is skipped the mapping is performed in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
For services b to h the 5GMM receives explicit start and stop indications from the upper layers.
For the case of handover of ongoing services b to d from non3GPP access the 5GMM receives an additional explicit handover of ongoing service from non3GPP access indication from the upper layers.
The 5GMM may receive an additional explicit callpullinitiated indication from the upper layers see 3GPP TS 24.174 13D.
Once the service has successfully passed access control then as long as the service is ongoing the following access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid double barring
for services b c and d
1 any service request procedure related to the PDU session established for DNN = IMS except between receiving from the lower layers an indication that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2 or access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0 and receiving from the lower layers an indication that the barring is alleviated for the access category determined for the access attempt

#### 4.5.6	Mapping between access categories/access identities and RRC establishment cause
When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NASsignalling connection the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to one or more access identities see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A and the determined access category by checking the rules specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the access attempt matches more than one rule the RRC establishment cause of the lowest rule number shall be used. If the determined access category is an operatordefined access category then the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access identities see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A and the standardized access category determined for the operatordefined access category as described in subclause 4.5.3.
NOTE 1 Following an RRC release with redirection the lower layers can set the RRC establishment cause or the resume cause to mpsPriorityAccess in the case of redirection to an NR cell connected to 5GCN see 3GPP TS 38.331 or to highPriorityAccess in the case of redirection to an EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN see 3GPP TS 36.331 25A if the network indicates to the UE during RRC connection release with redirection that the UE has an active MPS session.
NOTE 2 When the UE is acting as a 5G ProSe layer2 UEtonetwork relay UE it is possible for the lower layer to decide an applicable RRC establishment cause according to the request from the 5G ProSe layer2 remote UE or according to the indication from upper layers including the case when the request from the 5G ProSe layer2 remote UE is for emergency services as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 .

#### 4.6.1	General
The 5GS supports network slicing as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 . Within a PLMN or SNPN a network slice is identified by an SNSSAI which is comprised of a sliceservice type SST and a slice differentiator SD. Inclusion of an SD in an SNSSAI is optional. A set of one or more SNSSAIs is called the NSSAI. The following SNSSAIs and NSSAIs are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
a configured NSSAI
b requested NSSAI
c allowed NSSAI
d subscribed SNSSAIs
e pending NSSAI
f alternative SNSSAIs and
g partially allowed NSSAI.
The following SNSSAIs and NSSAIs are defined in the present document
a rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN
b rejected NSSAI for the current registration area
c rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA
d rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached
e alternative NSSAI
f partially rejected NSSAI
g ondemand SNSSAIs and
h ondemand NSSAI.
In roaming scenarios rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN rejected NSSAI for the current registration area rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached or partially rejected NSSAI includes one or more SNSSAIs for the current PLMN and also contains a set of mapped SNSSAIs. An SNSSAI included in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA is an HPLMN SNSSAI.
In case of a PLMN a serving PLMN may configure a UE with
a the configured NSSAI per PLMN
b NSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscriptionbased restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature
c ondemand NSSAI if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature
d SNSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information and
e SNSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports SNSSAI location validity information.
In addition the HPLMN may configure a UE with a single default configured NSSAI and consider the default configured NSSAI as valid in a PLMN for which the UE has neither a configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI. The support for NSSRG information by the UE and the network respectively is optional.
NOTE 0 In this version of the specification the network slice usage control feature is not supported in roaming scenarios.
NOTE 1 The values used in the default configured NSSAI are expected to be commonly decided by all roaming partners e.g. values standardized by 3GPP or other bodies.
In case of an SNPN the SNPN may configure a UE which is neither registering nor registered for onboarding services in SNPN with
a a configured NSSAI applicable to the SNPN
b NSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscriptionbased restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature
c SNSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information
d ondemand NSSAI if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature and
e SNSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports SNSSAI location validity information.
In addition the credential holder may configure a single default configured NSSAI associated with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the PLMN subscription and consider the default configured NSSAI as valid in a SNPN for which the UE has neither a configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI. If the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN the serving SNPN shall not provide a configured NSSAI to the UE. The support for NSSRG information by the UE and the network respectively is optional.
The allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area are managed per access type independently i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area. If the UE does not have a valid registration area the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area is applicable to the tracking area on which it was received. If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs which are equivalent PLMNs the allowed NSSAI the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA and rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached are applicable to these PLMNs in this registration area.
The allowed NSSAI that is associated with a registration area containing TAIs belonging to different PLMNs which are equivalent PLMNs can be used to form the requested NSSAI for any of the equivalent PLMNs when the UE is outside of the registration area where the allowed NSSAI was received.
When the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is to be initiated for one or more SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI or the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing for one or more SNSSAIs these SNSSAIs will be included in the pending NSSAI. When the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is completed for an NSSAI that has been in the pending NSSAI the SNSSAI will be moved to the allowed NSSAI or rejected NSSAI depending on the outcome of the procedure. The AMF sends the updated allowed NSSAI to the UE over the same access of the requested SNSSAI. The AMF sends the updated partially allowed NSSAI to the UE only over the 3GPP access. The AMF sends the updated rejected NSSAI over either 3GPP access or non3GPP access. The pending NSSAI is managed regardless of access type i.e. the pending NSSAI is applicable to both 3GPP access and non3GPP access for the current PLMN even if sent over only one of the accesses. If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs which are equivalent PLMNs the pending NSSAI is applicable to these PLMNs in this registration area.
The rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type. The AMF shall only send a rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN when the registration area consists of TAIs that only belong to the registered PLMN. If the UE receives a rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and the registration area also contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN as applicable to the whole registered PLMN.
The rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA includes one or more SNSSAIs that have failed the network slicespecific authentication and authorization or for which the authorization have been revoked and are applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type.
The rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN and the access type over which the rejected NSSAI was sent. The AMF shall send a rejected NSSAI including SNSSAIs with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached when one or more SNSSAIs are indicated that the maximum number of UEs has been reached. If the timer T3526 associated with the SNSSAIs was started upon reception of the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached the UE may remove the SNSSAIs from the rejected NSSAI including SNSSAIs with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached if the timer T3526 associated with the SNSSAIs expires. If one or more SNSSAIs are removed from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached the timer T3526 associated with the removed SNSSAIs shall be stopped if running. The UE shall not stop the timer T3526 if the UE selects an EUTRA cell connected to EPC.
If the UE receives a rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs which are equivalent PLMNs the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached as applicable to these equivalent PLMNs when the UE is in this registration area.
If the UE has indicated that the UE supports network slice replacement feature and the AMF determines to provide the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE the network shall provide the UE with the alternative NSSAI. The alternative NSSAI is managed per access type independently i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area.
If the UE has indicated that the UE supports the partial network slice feature and includes the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI the AMF determines the SNSSAIs to be included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.11. When the AMF provides both the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE each SNSSAI shall be either in the partially allowed NSSAI or in the partially rejected NSSAI but not both. The number of SNSSAIs included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI shall not exceed 7. The sum of the number of SNSSAIs stored in the partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI shall not exceed 8. The partially allowed NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area. The partially rejected NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area.
NOTE 2 Based on local policies the UE can remove an SNSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the UE wants to register to the slice identified by this SNSSAI.
NOTE 3 Based on network local policy network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure can be initiated by the AMF for an SNSSAI in rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the SNSSAI is requested by the UE based on its local policy.
NOTE 4 At least one SNSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default SNSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service even when Network Slicespecific Authentication and Authorization fails.
NOTE 5 At least one SNSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default SNSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slice admission control in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service.
NOTE 6 The rejected NSSAI can be provided by the network via either Rejected NSSAI IE or the Extended rejected NSSAI IE.
##### 4.6.2.1	General
Upon registration to a PLMN or SNPN except for the registration procedure for periodic registration update the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN and the registration procedure for mobility registration update when registered for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall send to the AMF the requested NSSAI which includes one or more SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN or the configured NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN and corresponds to the network slices to which the UE intends to register with if
a the UE has a configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN
b the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN or
c the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN nor configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN and has a default configured NSSAI. In this case the UE indicates to the AMF that the requested NSSAI is created from the default configured NSSAI.
In roaming scenarios if the mapped SNSSAIs associated to the allowed NSSAI or the configured NSSAI are missing the UE shall locally set the mapped SNSSAI to the same value as the received SNSSAI. Additionally if the UE receives a Rejected NSSAI IE or an Extended rejected NSSAI IE without associated mapped SNSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI is different from the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA the UE shall locally set the mapped SNSSAIs to the same value as the received SNSSAI.
NOTE 1 The above occurs only when the UE is roaming and the AMF is compliant with earlier versions of the specification omits providing to the UE a mapped SNSSAI for one or more SNSSAIs in e.g. the allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI.
Other than SNSSAIs contained in the NSSAIs described above the requested NSSAI can be formed based on the SNSSAIs available in the UE see subclause 5.5.1.3.2 for further details. In roaming scenarios the UE shall also provide the mapped SNSSAIs for the requested NSSAI.
NOTE 2 If the UE did not receive a mapped SNSSAI for one or more SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI the UE still uses the SNSSAI as received from the serving network i.e. without the locally set mapped SNSSAI in any NAS message.
The AMF verifies if the requested NSSAI is permitted based on the subscribed SNSSAIs in the UE subscription and in roaming scenarios the mapped SNSSAIs provided by the UE and if so then the AMF shall provide the UE with the allowed NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN and shall also provide the UE with the mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN. Additionally if the AMF allows one or more subscribed SNSSAIs for the UE the AMF may include the allowed subscribed SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF shall ensure that there are not two or more SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI which are mapped to the same SNSSAI of the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN. If
a all the SNSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI are rejected or the requested NSSAI was not included by the UE
b all default SNSSAIs are not allowed and
c the UE is neither registering nor registered for onboarding services in SNPN and the UE is neither registering nor registered for emergency services
then the AMF may reject the registration request see subclauses 5.5.1.2.5 and 5.5.1.3.5 for further details.
In roaming scenarios if the mapped SNSSAIs associated to requested NSSAI are missing the AMF shall locally set the mapped SNSSAI to the same value as the received SNSSAI.
NOTE 3 In roaming scenarios when the UE is compliant with earlier versions of the specification or when the serving network does not provide a mapped SNSSAI for one or more SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI the UE can omit a mapped SNSSAI for one or more SNSSAIs in requested NSSAI.
The set of network slices for a UE can be changed at any time while the UE is registered to a PLMN or SNPN and the change may be initiated by the network or the UE. In this case the allowed NSSAI and associated registration area may be changed during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure. The configured NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI may be changed during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure. The default configured NSSAI may be changed by sending a UE parameters update transparent container to the UE during the NAS transport procedure. The pending NSSAI may be changed during the registration procedure. In addition using the generic UE configuration update procedure the network may trigger the registration procedure in order to update the allowed NSSAI.
The UE in NBN1 mode does not include the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure if the 5GS registration type IE indicates mobility registration updating procedure is not initiated to change the slices that the UE is currently registered to and the UE is still in the current registration area.
The AMF does not include the allowed NSSAI during a registration procedure with the 5GS registration type IE indicating mobility registration updating for the UE in NBN1 mode except if the allowed NSSAI has changed for the UE.
The UE does not include the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure if the 5GS registration type IE indicates SNPN onboarding registration or the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN. The AMF does not include the allowed NSSAI during a registration procedure with the 5GS registration type IE indicating SNPN onboarding registration or during a registration procedure when the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN.
The UE considers the last received allowed NSSAI as valid until the UE receives a new allowed NSSAI.
##### 4.6.2.2	NSSAI storage
If available the configured NSSAIs shall be stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C. For a configured NSSAI if there is
a associated NSSRG information the NSSRG information shall also be stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C

e associated ondemand NSSAI the ondemand NSSAI shall also be stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C.
Each of the configured NSSAI stored in the UE including the default configured NSSAI is a set composed of at most 16 SNSSAIs. Each of the configured NSSAI except the default configured NSSAI is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription.
The allowed NSSAIs should be stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C. The partially allowed NSSAIs should be stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C.
Each of the allowed NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 8 SNSSAIs and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity an access type and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of the alternative NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 8 pairs of SNSSAI to be replaced and alternative SNSSAI and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity an access type and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of the partially allowed NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 7 SNSSAIs and a list of TAs for which SNSSAI is supported and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity 3GPP access type and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. The sum of number of SNSSAIs stored in the partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI shall not exceed 8.
Each of the pending NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 16 SNSSAIs and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription.
Each of the rejected NSSAI is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. The SNSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area are further associated with one or more tracking areas where the rejected SNSSAIs is not available. The SNSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached are further associated with the access type over which the rejected NSSAI was received. The SNSSAIs in the partially rejected NSSAI are further associated with 3GPP access.
There shall be no duplicated PLMN identities or SNPN identities associated with each of the list of configured NSSAIs pending NSSAIs rejected NSSAIs for the current PLMN or SNPN rejected NSSAIs for the current registration area rejected NSSAIs for the failed or revoked NSSAA and rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached.
The UE stores NSSAIs as follows
a The configured NSSAI shall be stored until a new configured NSSAI is received for a given PLMN or SNPN. The network may provide to the UE the mapped SNSSAIs for the new configured NSSAI which shall also be stored in the UE. When the UE is provisioned with a new configured NSSAI for a PLMN or SNPN the UE shall
1 replace any stored configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN with the new configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN
2 delete any stored mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI and if available store the mapped SNSSAIs for the new configured NSSAI
3 delete any stored allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN and if available the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI if the UE received the new configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN and the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration requested bit set to registration requested in the same CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message but without any new allowed NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN included
4 delete any stored rejected NSSAI and partially rejected NSSAI and stop any timer T3526 associated with a deleted SNSSAI in the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached if running
4A delete any stored mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI and
5 delete any SNSSAIs stored in the pending NSSAI that are not included in the new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN or any mapped SNSSAIs if any stored in the pending NSSAI that are not included in the mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI if the UE is roaming or is in a nonsubscribed SNPN
If the UE having a stored configured NSSAI for a PLMN ID receives an SNSSAI associated with a PLMN ID from the network during the PDN connection establishment procedure in EPS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 or via ePDG as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 the UE may store the received SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI for the PLMN identified by the PLMN ID associated with the SNSSAI if not already included in the configured NSSAI and if the number of SNSSAIs in the configured NSSAI is less than 16
The UE may continue storing a received configured NSSAI for a PLMN and associated mapped SNSSAIs if available when the UE registers in another PLMN.
NOTE 1 The maximum number of configured NSSAIs and associated mapped SNSSAIs for PLMNs other than the HPLMN that need to be stored in the UE and how to handle the stored entries are up to UE implementation.
aa The NSAG information shall be stored until
1 a new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access or
2 a new configured NSSAI without any associated NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access.
The UE shall remove any SNSSAI from the NSAG information which is not part of the configured NSSAI if any.
NOTE 1A If the UE is roaming or the current SNPN is a nonsubscribed SNPN the UE uses the SNSSAIs in the configured NSSAI to compare against any SNSSAI from the NSAG information.
When a new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access the UE shall replace any stored NSAG information for the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or the registered SNPN and its equivalent SNPNs with the new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
When a new configured NSSAI without any associated NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access the UE shall delete any stored NSAG information for the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or the registered SNPN and its equivalent SNPNs.
The UE shall be able to store 32 NSAG entries in the NSAG information stored for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
The UE shall be able to store TAI lists for up to 4 NSAG entries in the NSAG information stored for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
The UE needs not to store the NSAG information when the UE is switched off or when the UE is deregistered from the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
NOTE 1B The UE stores the NSAG information associated with the configured NSSAI for at least the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or the registered SNPN and its equivalent PLMNs.
b The allowed NSSAI shall be stored and the mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI if available shall be stored for a given PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or SNPN until
1 a new allowed NSSAI for the same access type i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access is received for a given PLMN or SNPN
2 the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE set to registration requested is received and contains no other parameters see subclauses 5.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3

4 a new partially allowed NSSAI via 3GPP access is received for a given PLMN or SNPN.
b1 The UE shall delete the stored partially allowed NSSAI and stored mapped SNSSAIs for partially allowed NSSAI over 3GPP access when
1 new partially allowed NSSAI for a PLMN or SNPN is received and the new partially allowed NSSAI does not include any SNSSAIs
2 the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE set to registration requested is received and contains no other parameters see subclauses 5.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3 or

6 remove from the stored pending NSSAI for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or this SNPN one or more SNSSAIs if any included in the new allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and these equivalent PLMNs if the UE is not roaming or the current SNPN if the SNPN is the subscribed SNPN or the mapped SNSSAIs for the new allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and these equivalent PLMNs if the UE is roaming or the current SNPN if the SNPN is a nonsubscribed SNPN.
NOTE 2 Whether the UE stores the allowed NSSAI and the mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI also when the UE is switched off is implementation specific.
The network may provide to the UE the partially allowed NSSAI. When a new partially allowed NSSAI for a PLMN or SNPN is received and the new partially allowed NSSAI includes one or more SNSSAIs the UE shall
1 replace any stored partially allowed NSSAI for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or this SNPN via the 3GPP access with the new partially allowed NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN

ba The alternative NSSAI and the mapped SNSSAIs for the alternative NSSAI if the UE is roaming shall be stored for a given PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or SNPN until a new alternative NSSAI for the same access type i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access is received for a given PLMN or SNPN.
When a new alternative NSSAI for a given PLMN or SNPN is received and the new alternative NSSAI includes a list of mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI the UE shall
1 replace any stored alternative NSSAI for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or this SNPN for the same access type with the new alternative NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN and
2 delete any stored mapped SNSSAIs for the alternative NSSAI for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or this SNPN for the same access type and if available store the mapped SNSSAIs for the new alternative NSSAI.
When a new alternative NSSAI for a given PLMN or SNPN is received and the new alternative NSSAI does not include any mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI the UE shall delete any stored alternative NSSAI for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or this SNPN for the same access type.
When the UE locally removes either the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI upon expiry of the associated slice deregistration inactivity timer or the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is not available the UE shall delete the entry including the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI stored in the alternative NSSAI.
NOTE 3 Whether the UE stores the alternative NSSAI and the mapped SNSSAIs for the alternative NSSAI also when the UE is switched off is implementation specific.
c When the UE receives the SNSSAIs included in the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the REGISTRATION REJECT message the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message or the partially rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the UE shall
1 store the SNSSAIs into the rejected NSSAI and the mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI based on the associated rejection causes

When the UE receives ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message provided with SNSSAI and the PLMN ID in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE see subclause 6.5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE may remove the SNSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached for each and every access type if any and stop the timer T3526 associated with the SNSSAI if running.
When the UE
1 deregisters over an access type
2 successfully registers in a new registration area over an access type
3 enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED or 5GMMREGISTERED following an unsuccessful registration in a new registration area over an access type or
4 performs intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE successfully completes tracking area update procedure
the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area corresponding to the access type and the partially rejected NSSAI shall be deleted. When a new partially rejected NSSAI is received without any SNSSAIs the UE shall delete any stored partially rejected NSSAI for the current registration area
d When the UE receives the pending NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall replace any stored pending NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN with the new pending NSSAI received in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message for this PLMN or SNPN. If the UE does not receive the pending NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the “NSSAA to be performed” indicator is not set to “Network slicespecific authentication and authorization is to be performed” in the 5GS registration result IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall delete the stored pending NSSAI if any for this PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or this SNPN.
If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs which are equivalent PLMNs then for each of the equivalent PLMNs the UE shall replace any stored pending NSSAI with the pending NSSAI received in the registered PLMN.

If the timers were running for multiple other PLMNs or equivalent SNPNs see subclause 6.2.8 the UE shall stop the timers for all such PLMNs or equivalent SNPNs.
##### 4.6.2.3	Provision of NSSAI to lower layers in 5GMM-IDLE mode
The UE NAS layer may provide the lower layers with an NSSAI either requested NSSAI or allowed NSSAI when the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode sends an initial NAS message.
The AMF may indicate via the NSSAI inclusion mode IE of a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message an NSSAI inclusion mode in which the UE shall operate over the current access within the current PLMN or SNPN if any see subclauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4 where the NSSAI inclusion mode is chosen among the following NSSAI inclusion modes described in table 4.6.2.3.1.
Table 4.6.2.3.1 NSSAI inclusion modes and NSSAI which shall be provided to the lower layers
The UE shall store the NSSAI inclusion mode
a indicated by the AMF if the AMF included the NSSAI inclusion mode IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or
b if the AMF did not include the NSSAI inclusion mode IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
1 if the UE is preconfigured by operator to operate by default to according to mode C in the HPLMN if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty or EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present see the DefaultNSSAIInclusionMode leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 then mode C
2 otherwise
i mode D for 3GPP access and trusted non3GPP access or
ii mode B for untrusted non3GPP access and wireline access.
together with the identity of the current PLMN or SNPN and access type in a nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C.
The UE shall apply the NSSAI inclusion mode received in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message over the current access within the current PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs if any or the current SNPN in the current registration area.
When a UE performs a registration procedure to a PLMN which is not a PLMN in the current registration area or an SNPN if the UE has no NSSAI inclusion mode for the PLMN or the SNPN stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME the UE shall provide the lower layers with
a no NSSAI if the UE is performing the registration procedure over 3GPP access or
b requested NSSAI if the UE is performing the registration procedure over non3GPP access.
When a UE performs a registration procedure after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode if the UE has no NSSAI inclusion mode for the PLMN stored in a nonvolatile memory in the ME and the registration procedure is performed over 3GPP access the UE shall not provide the lower layers with any NSSAI over the 3GPP access.
##### 4.6.2.4	Network slice-specific authentication and authorization
The UE and network may support network slicespecific authentication and authorization.
A serving PLMN or SNPN shall perform network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs of the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN which are subject to it based on subscription information. The UE shall indicate whether it supports network slicespecific authentication and authorization in the 5GMM Capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2.
The upper layer stores an association between each SNSSAI and its corresponding credentials for the network slicespecific authentication and authorization.
NOTE 1 The credentials for network slicespecific authentication and authorization and how to provision them in the upper layer are out of the scope of 3GPP.
The network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed unless the primary authentication and key agreement procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.1 has successfully been completed.
The AMF informs the UE about SNSSAIs for which network slicespecific authentication and authorization except for reNSSAA will be performed or is ongoing in the pending NSSAI. The AMF informs the UE about SNSSAIs for which NSSAA procedure is completed as success in the allowed NSSAI or in the partially allowed NSSAI. The AMF informs the UE about SNSSAIs for which NSSAA procedure is completed as failure in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA. The AMF stores and handles allowed NSSAI partially allowed NSSAI pending NSSAI rejected NSSAI and 5GS registration result in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message according to subclauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4.
NOTE 2 The AMF maintains the NSSAA procedure status for each SNSSAI as specified in 3GPP TS 29.518 20B and the NSSAA procedure status for each SNSSAI is not impacted by NSAC as specified in subclauses 4.6.2.5 and 4.6.3.1.
NOTE 3 Upon completion of NSSAA procedures it can happen that the total number of SNSSAIs which need to be included in the allowed NSSAI exceeds eight. In this case it is up to the AMF implementation on how to pick up the SNSSAIs included in the allowed NSSAI.
NOTE 4 It can happen that one or more SNSSAIs included in the received allowed NSSAI are not the SNSSAIs that the UE intends to register to. In this case it is up to the UE implementation on how to use these SNSSAIs.
To perform network slicespecific authentication and authorization for an SNSSAI the AMF invokes an EAPbased network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure for the SNSSAI see subclause 5.4.7 and 3GPP TS 23.502 using the EAP framework as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The AMF updates the allowed NSSAI the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4 after the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is completed.
The AMF shall send the pending NSSAI containing all SNSSAIs for which the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure except for reNSSAA will be performed or is ongoing in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF shall also include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the allowed NSSAI containing one or more SNSSAIs from the requested NSSAI which are allowed by the AMF and for which network slicespecific authentication and authorization is not required if any. The AMF shall also include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the partially allowed NSSAI containing one or more SNSSAIs from the requested NSSAI which are allowed by the AMF in a list of TAs within the current registration area and for which network slicespecific authentication and authorization is not required if any.
The network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedure or the network slicespecific authorization revocation procedure can be invoked by the network for a UE supporting NSSAA at any time. After the network performs the network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedure or network slicespecific authorization revocation procedure
a if network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked for some but not all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4 and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI for which network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked
b if network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked for all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI but there are one or more default SNSSAIs which are not subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization or for which the network slicespecific authentication and authorization has been successfully performed the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default SNSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4. The AMF shall also inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI for which network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked or
c if network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked for all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and all default SNSSAIs are subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization and the network slicespecific authentication and authorization has not been successfully performed for any of these default SNSSAIs then AMF performs the networkinitiated deregistration procedure and includes the rejected NSSAI in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in the subclause 5.5.2.3 except when the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU session. In this case the AMF shall send the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message containing rejected NSSAI and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI for which network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization fails or network slicespecific authorization is revoked. After the emergency PDU session is released the AMF performs the networkinitiated deregistration procedure as specified in the subclause 5.5.2.3.
The UE does not include in the requested NSSAI any of the SNSSAIs from the pending NSSAI that the UE stores regardless of the access type. When the UE storing a pending NSSAI intends to register to one or more additional SNSSAIs not included in the pending NSSAI the UE initiates the registration procedure with a requested NSSAI containing these SNSSAIs as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.2. In this case the requested NSSAI shall also include one or more SNSSAIs from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI if the UE still wants to use the SNSSAIs from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI.
During the registration procedure when the AMF receives a requested NSSAI from a UE over an access type for which there is a pending NSSAI including one or more SNSSAIs that were previously requested over the same access type the AMF considers SNSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI and SNSSAIs in the pending NSSAI that were previously requested over the same access type as requested SNSSAIs by the UE. The AMF handles the requested SNSSAIs as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.4.
When performing the network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedure if the SNSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAI for both 3GPP and non3GPP accesses and the UE is registered to both 3GPP and non3GPP accesses in the same PLMN then the AMF selects an access type to perform network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization based upon operator policy.
If network slicespecific authorization is revoked for an SNSSAI that is in the current allowed NSSAI for an access type or for an SNSSAI that is in the current partially allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access type the AMF shall
a provide a new allowed NSSAI or a new partially allowed NSSAI excluding the SNSSAI for which the network slicespecific authorization is revoked and
b provide a new rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA including the SNSSAI for which the network slicespecific authorization is revoked with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network slicespecific authentication and authorization
to the UE using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4 and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI for which the network slicespecific authorization is revoked for this access type.
If the UE requests the establishment of a new PDU session or the modification of a PDU session for an SNSSAI for which the AMF is performing network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedure the AMF may determine to not forward the 5GSM message to the SMF as described in subclause 5.4.5.2.4.
NOTE 5 If the AMF receives the HTTP code set to 4xx or 5xx as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 20AA or the AMF detects that the NSSAAF failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.526 21A during the NSSAA procedure for an SNSSAI then the AMF considers the NSSAA procedure has failed for this SNSSAI.
##### 4.6.2.5	Mobility management based network slice admission control
A serving PLMN or SNPN can perform network slice admission control for the SNSSAIs subject to NSAC to monitor and control the number of registered UEs per network slice. The timing of the network slice admission control is managed by the EAC mode per network slice which can be either activated or deactivated for the network performing network slice admission control. The EAC mode is activated when the number of UEs associated with the SNSSAI reaches a certain threshold see 3GPP TS 23.502
If the EAC mode is activated for an SNSSAI the AMF performs network slice admission control before the SNSSAI subject to NSAC is included in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI sent to the UE. During a registration procedure including initial registration or mobility registration updating from another AMF if the AMF determines that the maximum number of UEs has been reached for
a one or more SNSSAIs but not all SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI then the AMF includes the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in the subclauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4
b all SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI but there are one or more default SNSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE then the AMF includes the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default SNSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in the subclauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4 or
c all SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI and there are no default SNSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE then the AMF includes the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION REJECT message as specified in the subclauses 5.5.1.2.5 and 5.5.1.3.5.
If the EAC mode is deactivated for an SNSSAI the AMF performs network slice admission control after the SNSSAI subject to NSAC is included in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI sent to the UE. While the AMF is waiting for response from the NSACF for the SNSSAI the AMF processes the NAS signalling message related to the SNSSAI as usual i.e. like SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI. After the network performs the network slice admission control if the AMF determines that the maximum number of UEs has been reached for
a one or more SNSSAIs but not all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI then the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4
b for all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI but there are one or more default SNSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE then the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default SNSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4 or
c for all SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and there are no default SNSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE then the AMF performs the networkinitiated deregistration procedure and includes the rejected NSSAI in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in the subclause 5.5.2.3 except when the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU session.
When the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU session the AMF updates the rejected NSSAI using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause 5.4.4 and informs the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI. During the generic UE configuration update procedure the AMF includes the 5GS registration result IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and sets the Emergency registered bit of the 5GS registration result IE to Registered for emergency services. After the emergency PDU session is released the AMF performs the networkinitiated deregistration procedure as specified in the subclause 5.5.2.3.
Based on operator policy the mobility management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the SNSSAI used for emergency services or the mobility management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the SNSSAI used for emergency services.
Based on operator policy the mobility management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the UEs configured for priority services or the mobility management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the UEs configured for priority services.
NOTE A UE configured for priority services can be identified based on the RRC establishment cause received from the NGRAN or based on the MPS priority information in the users subscription context obtained from the UDM.
The mobility management based network slice admission control is not applicable to a UE that is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN.
##### 4.6.2.6	Provision of NSAG information to lower layers
The support for NSAG information by the UE and the network respectively is optional. The NSAG information provided by the network and stored in the UE includes a list of NSAGs each of which contains
a an NSAG ID
b a list of SNSSAIs which are associated with the NSAG and shall be part of the configured NSSAI
NOTE 0 An alternative SNSSAI is added to the configured NSSAI if not included yet.
c a priority value that is associated with the NSAG and
NOTE 1 The AMF can take local configuration UE 5GMM capabilities subscribed SNSSAIs the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI HPLMN etc. to determine the NSAG priority information for the associated NSAG to a UE.
d optionally a list of TAIs in which the NSAG is valid. If it is not provided by the network the NSAG is valid in the PLMN or SNPN which has sent the NSAG information and its equivalent PLMNs.
NOTE 2 If the NSAG for the PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs have different associations with SNSSAIs then the AMF includes a list of TAIs in the NSAG information.
The UE NAS layer shall provide the lower layers with
a the most recent NSAG information stored in the UE see subclause 4.6.2.2
b the allowed NSSAI and the partially allowed NSSAI if any or the requested NSSAI for the purpose of network slicebased cell reselection see 3GPP TS 23.501 and
c zero or more SNSSAIs related to an access attempt for the purpose of network slicebased random access when the access attempt is made by the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode or 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication determined as follows
i requested NSSAI if any if an access attempt occurred due to the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
ii NSSAIs associated with all the PDU sessions included in the Uplink data status IE if any PDU session status IE if any or Allowed PDU session status IE if any if an access attempt occurred due to the SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
iii the SNSSAI associated with the PDU session if an access attempt occurred due to
an uplink user data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended userplane resources
an UL NAS TRANSPORT which carries a 5GSM message for a PDU session associated with an SNSSAI if any or
CIoT user data to be sent in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message or an UL NAS TRANSPORT message
iv no SNSSAI if an access attempt occurred due to
the deregistration procedure
a PDU session establishment request not associated with an SNSSAI
the service request procedure for the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure for sending SMS LPP message UPPCMI container SLPP message SOR transparent container UE policy container UE parameters update transparent container or a location services message or
emergency services or
v the allowed NSSAI if any and the partially allowed NSSAI if any if an access attempt occurred for other reason than those specified in bullets i iv.
##### 4.6.2.7	Mobility management based network slice replacement
The support for network slice replacement by a UE or network is optional. If the UE and network support network slice replacement and the AMF determines that an SNSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced with an alternative SNSSAI the AMF provides
a the alternative SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI if not included yet
b the alternative SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI if not included yet
c the alternative SNSSAI in the NSAG information if not included yet and the UE supports NSAG and
d the alternative NSSAI including the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the corresponding alternative SNSSAI
to the UE during the generic UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure as follows
a for nonroaming UE the AMF provides the mapping information between the SNSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE or
NOTE 1 In nonroaming scenarios the alternative SNSSAI does not have to be part of the subscribed SNSSAIs in the UE subscription.
b for roaming UE
1 if the SNSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced i.e. the SNSSAI to be replaced is part of the VPLMN SNSSAIs the AMF provides the mapping information between the SNSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE and
2 if the SNSSAI included in the mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced i.e. the SNSSAI to be replaced is part of the HPLMN SNSSAIs the AMF provides the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE.
NOTE 1A In roaming scenarios the alternative SNSSAI being part of the HPLMN SNSSAIs does not have to be part of the subscribed SNSSAIs in the UE subscription.
NOTE 2 It is up to AMF local policy to determine when to provide the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE which can be either when the alternative SNSSAI is available and there is no established PDU session associated with the SNSSAI to be replaced or when the UE has established the first PDU session associated with the SNSSAI to be replaced.
If the requested NSSAI contains alternative SNSSAIs that are not subscribed SNSSAIs the AMF shall verify the alternative SNSSAIs based on the stored alternative NSSAI.
If the alternative SNSSAI is subject to NSSAA the alternative SNSSAI provided by AMF shall be part of the subscribed SNSSAIs in the UE subscription. The AMF shall perform NSSAA procedure for such alternative SNSSAI and perform network slice replacement as specified above after the NSSAA procedure for the alternative SNSSAI is completed as success.
If reNSSAA procedure is ongoing for the SNSSAI to be replaced the AMF shall continue with the reNSSAA procedure and perform network slice replacement as specified above after the reNSSAA procedure for the SNSSAI to be replaced is completed as success.
NOTE 2A When configuring the alternative SNSSAI the maximum number of SNSSAIs defined for the allowed NSSAI and configured NSSAI in subclause 4.6.2.2 are applicable.
If the AMF determines that the replaced SNSSAI is available again the AMF provides the updated alternative NSSAI excluding the replaced SNSSAI and the corresponding alternative SNSSAI to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure.
If all the replaced SNSSAIs in alternative NSSAI are available again the AMF provides the alternative NSSAI with Length of Alternative NSSAI contents set to 0 in the UE configuration update procedure or registration procedure.
NOTE 3 If there is SNSSAI location validity information for both the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI the NSAoS of the alternative SNSSAI is the same as or larger than the NSAoS of the SNSSAI to be replaced.
If the UE is in a cell outside the NSAoS of the replaced SNSSAI but within the NSAoS of the alternative SNSSAI the AMF provides the updated allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI excluding the replaced SNSSAI if included in the allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure.
If the alternative SNSSAI is not part of the subscribed SNSSAIs and
a the replaced SNSSAI is removed from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI or
b the replaced SNSSAI is available again
then the AMF shall provide updated allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI excluding the alternative SNSSAI to the UE over the current access type during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure. Additionally if the alternative SNSSAI is not included in allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI over the other access type
a for case a the AMF may also provide updated configured NSSAI excluding the alternative SNSSAI to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure or
b for case b the AMF shall also provide updated configured NSSAI excluding the alternative SNSSAI to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure.
Based on SMF local configuration if the replaced SNSSAI is subject to NSAC or the alternative SNSSAI is subject to NSAC or both the SMF may perform NSAC for the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI or both.
If the alternative SNSSAI is not available and the replaced SNSSAI is not yet available the AMF provides the updated alternative NSSAI excluding the replaced SNSSAI and the alternative SNSSAI to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure.
##### 4.6.2.8	Mobility management for optimised handling of temporarily available network slices
The UE and the network may support optimised handling of temporarily available network slices. The support for SNSSAI time validity information by the UE and the network respectively is optional.
If the UE has indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information then the AMF may include the SNSSAI time validity information for one or more SNSSAIs included in the configured NSSAI in the Registration Accept message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. If the AMF determines that the SNSSAI time validity information for an SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI is changed the AMF may provide the UE with a new SNSSAI time validity information for that SNSSAI via the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the UE supporting SNSSAI time validity information is configured with SNSSAI time validity information for an SNSSAI and
a the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is available then the UE may request the SNSSAI in the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
b the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is not available then
i the UE shall not include the SNSSAI in the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
ii the UE shall remove the SNSSAI from the stored allowed NSSAI if any and the stored partially allowed NSSAI if any in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C
iii the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI will not become available again then the UE shall remove the SNSSAI from the stored configured NSSAI in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C and
iv the UE shall delete the entry from the alternative NSSAI if any containing the SNSSAI in the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.
NOTE 1 If the SNSSAI to be removed is the only SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI if applicable the UE can before the time validity expiry initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and include a different SNSSAI from the configured NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE does not initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and the time validity for the only SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI expires the UE locally enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
When the SNSSAI time validity information of an SNSSAI indicates that the SNSSAI is not available then
a if the AMF receives a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the SNSSAI identifying the network slice the AMF shall
i to a UE which has indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information provide
1 a configured NSSAI including the SNSSAI together with the SNSSAI time validity information in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the SNSSAI will become available again or
2 a configured NSSAI not including the SNSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the SNSSAI will not become available again or
ii to a UE which has not indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information reject the SNSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN. If the registration request is accepted the AMF shall include a configured NSSAI not including the SNSSAI
b if the AMF detects that the SNSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI of a UE which has
i indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information the AMF shall locally remove the SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI if any the partially allowed NSSAI if any and the entry from the alternative NSSAI if any containing the SNSSAI in the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI or
NOTE 2 If there is no SNSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI after local removal of the SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI the network locally enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED for the UE.
ii not indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information the AMF shall remove the SNSSAI from the stored configured NSSAI if any allowed NSSAI if any and partially allowed NSSAI if any by sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
When the SNSSAI time validity information of an SNSSAI indicates that the SNSSAI becomes available again the AMF shall update the configured NSSAI including the SNSSAI to a UE which has not indicated that it supports SNSSAI time validity information by sending CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message if the UE is subscribed to the SNSSAI.
The SNSSAI time validity information is applicable for the current PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type.
##### 4.6.2.9	Mobility management based network slice usage control
If the network supports network slice usage control the AMF monitors network slice usage by running a slice deregistration inactivity timer per SNSSAI and access type. If the UE supports network slice usage control the AMF may also provide ondemand NSSAI to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. The ondemand NSSAI consists of one or more ondemand SNSSAIs and optionally the slice deregistration inactivity timer per ondemand SNSSAI.
The slice deregistration inactivity timer is started using the stored slice deregistration inactivity timer value as follows
a for a PDU session which is released using 5GSM signalling after a PDU session is released and there is no established PDU session including any MA PDU session associated with the SNSSAI over the corresponding access type
b for a PDU session which is released locally
1 when the UE or AMF indicates via the PDU session status IE that a PDU session is now in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE and there is no established PDU session including any MA PDU session associated with the SNSSAI over the corresponding access type or
2 when the UE or AMF receives the the PDU session status IE for which a PDU session that was previously in 5GSM state PDU SESSION ACTIVE is now indicated as being in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE and there is no established PDU session including any MA PDU session associated with the SNSSAI over the corresponding access type or
c successful completion of handover of PDU session to other access and there is no established PDU session including any MA PDU session associated with the SNSSAI over the corresponding access type.
The slice deregistration inactivity timer is stopped and reset
a when at least a PDU session including any MA PDU session associated with the SNSSAI is successfully established over the corresponding access types or the SNSSAI is removed from the allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI or
b when the UE enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
NOTE 0A If the PDU session is established with an alternative SNSSAI then this PDU session is considered as associated with both the SNSSAI to be replaced and with the alternative SNSSAI.
If the slice deregistration inactivity timer value is updated the AMF updates the stored timer value and may provide the updated timer value to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message in a current or the next registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
When the UE receives an updated slice deregistration inactivity timer value in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message from the AMF the UE shall update the stored timer value.
Upon expiry of the slice deregistration inactivity timer the AMF
a for UE supporting network slice usage control shall locally remove the SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI over the corresponding access type. In addition the AMF may send the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE with the new allowed NSSAI and
b for UE not supporting network slice usage control shall provide the updated allowed NSSAI excluding the SNSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.
If the AMF locally removes either the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI upon expiry of the associated slice deregistration inactivity timer the AMF shall delete the entry including the replaced SNSSAI or the alternative SNSSAI stored in the alternative NSSAI.
The UE includes the ondemand SNSSAI which the UE requests in the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure. Upon expiry of the slice deregistration inactivity timer the UE shall locally remove the SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI over the corresponding access type. If the locally removed ondemand SNSSAI is included in the entry of the stored alternative NSSAI the UE shall delete the entry as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.
NOTE 0 If the UE determines the ondemand SNSSAI for a PDU session establishment as specified in subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 the UE includes the ondemand SNSSAI in the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure.
Ondemand NSSAI is associated with the configured NSSAI. The ondemand SNSSAIs is deleted by the UE from the stored ondemand NSSAI when the associated configured SNSSAIs is deleted by the UE from the stored configured NSSAI.
NOTE 1 Based on regulatory requirements and operator policy the AMF ensures that the network slice usage control does not apply for the SNSSAI used for emergency services.
NOTE 2 In this version of the specification the network slice usage control feature is not supported in roaming scenarios.
##### 4.6.2.10	Mobility management aspects of handling network slices with NS-AoS not matching deployed tracking areas
An operator can choose to let the NSAoS of an SNSSAI not match the existing tracking area boundaries see subclause 5.15.18 of 3GPP TS 23.501 . In order to support this deployment option the operator has to ensure that an AMF covering the NSAoS operates as described below.
The support for SNSSAI location validity information by the UE and the network respectively is optional. If a UE supports SNSSAI location validity information the UE indicates that it supports SNSSAI location validity information during the registration procedure see subclause 5.5.1. The AMF can provide a UE which has indicated that it supports SNSSAI location validity information with SNSSAI location validity information see subclauses 5.4.4 and 5.5.1. The SNSSAI location validity information consists of for each of the applicable SNSSAIs in the configured NSSAI
a an SNSSAI and
b a list of cell identities of TAs belonging to the registration area where the related SNSSAIs is available in some cells but not all cells of one or more TAs which represents the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
The UE shall consider itself to be inside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI if the cell identity of the current serving cell matches any of the identities in the SNSSAI location validity information. Otherwise the UE shall consider itself to be outside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
NOTE 1 The cell identity of the current serving cell is received from the lower layers.
For an SNSSAI in the SNSSAI location validity information even if the SNSSAI is included in the rejected NSSAI with a rejection cause value set to SNSSAI not available in the current registration area or is included in the partially rejected NSSAI the UE is allowed to request the SNSSAI if the UE determines that it is inside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
NOTE 2 If the service area list for the service area restrictions is available in the UE the service area list is evaluated before the SNSSAI location validity information.
For an SNSSAI limited by NSAoS if the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode does not support SNSSAI location validity information and the AMF determines that
a the UE is outside the NSAoS then the AMF may
1 provide the UE with an allowed NSSAI or a partially allowed NSSAI excluding the SNSSAI and optionally a configured NSSAI excluding the SNSSAI and
NOTE 3 If excluding the SNSSAI limited by NSAoS results in an empty allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI the AMF includes one or more default SNSSAIs in the provided allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI.
2 indicate to the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the SNSSAI or
b the UE is in the NSAoS then the AMF may update the configured NSSAI to include the SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI.
If the UE that does not support SNSSAI location validity information requests a PDU session establishment for an SNSSAI limited by NSAoS and the AMF determines that the UE is outside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI the AMF may perform SNSSAI based congestion control for the SNSSAI as specified in subclauses 5.3.11 and 5.4.5.
The SNSSAI location validity information is only applicable to 3GPP access.
##### 4.6.2.11	Mobility management for partial network slice
A serving PLMN or SNPN can indicate the SNSSAIs is allowed or rejected in some TAs but not all TAs of the registration area to the UE during the registration procedure as specified in subclause 5.5.1 and the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.4. The support for the partial network slice by a UE or an AMF is optional.
If the UE supports the partial network slice and includes the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI and
a if the SNSSAIs is allowed in the current TA but not all TAs of the registration area and
1 if the SNSSAIs is subject to NSAC for the maximum number of UEs the AMF should include the SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI to the UE and limit the registration area so that the SNSSAIs is allowed in all the TAs of the registration area
2 if the SNSSAIs is subject to NSSAA the AMF shall include the SNSSAIs in
i the pending NSSAI to the UE when the AMF is going to perform the network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs or
ii the partially allowed NSSAI to the UE after the network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs has been successfully performed and
3 otherwise the AMF shall include the SNSSAIs in the partially allowed NSSAI to the UE or
b if the SNSSAIs is rejected in the current TA but not all TAs of the registration area and
1 if the SNSSAI is subject to NSAC for the maximum number of UEs the AMF should include the SNSSAIs in the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE
2 if the SNSSAIs is subject to NSSAA the AMF shall include the SNSSAIs in
i the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE when the AMF determines not to perform the network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs
ii the pending NSSAI to the UE when the AMF is going to perform the network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs or
iii either the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE after the network slicespecific authentication and authorization for the SNSSAIs has been successfully performed
NOTE 1 The AMF determines whether to perform the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure for the partial network slice based on its own local policy.
3 if the SNSSAIs is associated with a slice deregistration inactivity timer on the AMF side as specified in subclause 4.6.2.9 the AMF shall include the SNSSAIs in the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE and
4 otherwise the AMF shall include the SNSSAIs in either the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE or
c if the partially allowed NSSAI the partially rejected NSSAI or both are changed the AMF shall provide the new partially allowed NSSAI the new partially rejected NSSAI or both to the UE.
Upon receiving the partially allowed NSSAI the UE shall regard the SNSSAIs included in partially allowed NSSAI if any as the allowed SNSSAIs for the current registration area and store the received partially allowed NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.
Upon receiving the partially rejected NSSAI the UE shall store the received partially rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. The UE shall not attempt to include the SNSSAI if any in the requested NSSAI if the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which SNSSAI is rejected.
The AMF shall ensure that there is also at least one SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI allocated to the UE as specified in subclause 5.15.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 .
The mobility management for partial network slice is only applicable to 3GPP access.
The mobility management for partial network slice is not applicable to a UE that is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN.
##### 4.6.3.0	General
In order to enable PDU transmission in a network slice the UE may request establishment of a PDU session in a network slice towards a data network DN which is associated with an SNSSAI and a data network name DNN if there is no established PDU session adequate for the PDU transmission. The SNSSAI included is part of allowed NSSAI of the serving PLMN or SNPN which is an SNSSAI value valid in the serving PLMN or SNPN and in roaming scenarios the mapped SNSSAI is also included for the PDU session if available. See subclause 6.4.1 for further details. The UE determines whether to establish a new PDU session or use one of the established PDU sessions based on the URSP rules which include SNSSAIs if any see subclause 6.2.9 or based on UE local configuration as described in subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 .
##### 4.6.3.1	Session management based network slice admission control
A serving PLMN or the HPLMN or SNPN can perform network slice admission control for the SNSSAIs subject to NSAC to monitor and control the total number of established PDU sessions per network slice. The SMF performs network slice admission control on the SNSSAI during the PDU session establishment procedure. If the maximum number of PDU sessions on a network slice associated with an SNSSAI has been already reached the SMF rejects the PDU session establishment request using SNSSAI based congestion control as specifed in subclause 6.2.8 and 6.4.1.4.2.
The SMF performs network slice admission control on the SNSSAI for a PDU session that is associated with the non3GPP access when the UE requests to transfer a session from the non3GPP access to the 3GPP access with the Allowed PDU session status IE as described in subclause 5.6.1.4. If the maximum number of PDU sessions on a network slice associated with an SNSSAI has been already reached the SMF rejects the request to establish the userplane resources see 3GPP TS 29.502 20A.
Based on operator policy the session management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the PDU session for emergency services or the session management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the PDU session for emergency services.
Based on operator policy the session management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the PDU session for priority services or the session management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the PDU session for priority services.
NOTE 1 The SMF can use the SbiMessagePriority field as defined in TS 29.500 20AA to determine whether the PDU session is for priority services.
The session management based network slice admission control is not applicable to PDU session established for onboarding services in SNPN.
NOTE 2 For the MA PDU session during the PDU session establishment procedure the SMF performs network slice admission control only when it is newly established over the associated access type.
NOTE 3 For a set of redundant PDU sessions the SMF performs network slice admission control for each PDU session independently.
##### 4.6.3.2	Support of network slice admission control and interworking with EPC
If EPS counting is required for a network slice the network performs network slice admission control for the SNSSAIs subject to NSAC to monitor and control the number of UEs per network slice and number of PDU sessions per network slice during the PDN connection establishment procedure. If the maximum number of UEs on a network slice associated with an SNSSAI or the maximum number of PDU sessions on a network slice associated with an SNSSAI have already been reached the network rejects the PDN connectivity request using ESM cause #26 insufficient resources as specifed in 3GPP TS 24.301 .
NOTE If there are more than one SNSSAI associated with the APN used in the PDN connectivity request and some of but not all associated SNSSAIs are not available due to either maximum number of UEs reached or maximum number of PDU sessions reached the network can use the associated SNSSAI for which maximum number of UEs and maximum number of PDU sessions have not reached to avoid PDN connectivity request rejection.
##### 4.6.3.3	Session management based network slice data rate limitation control
A serving PLMN or the HPLMN can perform network slice data rate limitation control for the SNSSAIs subject to network slice data rate limitation control to monitor and control the total data rate of established PDU sessions per network slice as specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 . If the maximum data rate of PDU sessions on a network slice associated with an SNSSAI has been exceeded during the PDU session establishment procedure the SMF may reject the PDU session establishment request using SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause 6.2.8 and 6.4.1.4.2.
A serving PLMN or the HPLMN can perform management of SliceMaximum Bit Rate per UE UESliceMBR as specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 . When the UESliceMBR for the UE and SNSSAI to which the PDU session is allocated is exceeded during the PDU session establishment procedure the SMF may reject the PDU session establishment request using SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause 6.2.8 and 6.4.1.4.2.
NOTE 1 Based on operator policy the network slice data rate limitation control can be not applicable for the SNSSAIs used for emergency services or priority services.
NOTE 2 The network slice data rate limitation control and UESliceMBR management are performed by the PCF.
##### 4.6.3.4	Session management based network slice replacement
If
a the UE and network support network slice replacement
b the UE is provided with the mapping information between the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI and
c the UE decides to establish a new PDU session with the SNSSAI to be replaced
the UE provides both the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure. If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 is running for the SNSSAI to be replaced the UE should not stop the timer during PDU session establishment procedure. If the SMF receives both the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure the SMF proceeds with the PDU session establishment procedure with the alternative SNSSAI. If the PDU session establishment request is accepted the SMF includes the alternative SNSSAI in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message. The SNSSAI for the established PDU session is the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI on the UE side.
If the UE is provided with the mapping of the VPLMN SNSSAI to a VPLMN alternative SNSSAI the UE provides both the VPLMN alternative SNSSAI and the VPLMN SNSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure. The AMF sends both VPLMN alternative SNSSAI and VPLMN SNSSAI to the SMF. If the UE is provided with the mapping of the HPLMN SNSSAI to an HPLMN Alternative SNSSAI the UE provides both the HPLMN alternative SNSSAI and the HPLMN SNSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure. The AMF sends both HPLMN alternative SNSSAI and HPLMN SNSSAI to the SMF.
If the SMF receives from the AMF an alternative SNSSAI for the existing PDU session and
a if the SMF decides to retain the existing PDU session i.e. the SMF can serve both the alternative SNSSAI and the SNSSAI to be replaced the SMF sends the alternative SNSSAI to the UE during networkrequested PDU session modification procedure or
b if the SMF decides to reactivate the existing PDU session and
1 if the SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 3 the SMF initiates PDU session modification procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE or
2 if the SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 the SMF initiates PDU session release procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE and the UE provides both the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure.
When the replaced SNSSAI becomes available again if the SMF receives from the AMF the replaced SNSSAI for the existing PDU session and
a if the SMF decides to retain the existing PDU session i.e. the SMF can serve the replaced SNSSAI the SMF sends the replaced SNSSAI to the UE during networkrequested PDU session modification procedure or
b if the SMF decides to reactivate the existing PDU session and
1 if the SSC mode of PDU session is SSC mode 3 the SMF sends the replaced SNSSAI to the UE during PDU session modification procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE or
2 if the SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 the SMF sends the replaced SNSSAI to the UE during PDU session release procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE and the UE provides the replaced SNSSAI during PDU establishment procedure.
If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 is running for the replaced SNSSAI and the replaced SNSSAI in alternative NSSAI is available and the AMF provides the updated allowed NSSAI and configured NSSAI to the UE the UE should stop the timer.
##### 4.6.3.5	Session management for optimized handling of temporarily available network slices
A network slice can be available temporarily. Subclause 4.6.2.8 addresses how the allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI are managed based on the SNSSAI time validity information.
If the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is available the UE may initiate a UErequested PDU session establishment procedure to establish a PDU session associated with the SNSSAI.
If the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is not available then the UE shall
a initiate UErequested PDU session release procedure to release any PDU session associated with the SNSSAI if the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode or in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication or
b locally release any PDU session associated with the SNSSAI if the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode.
When the SNSSAI time validity information in the AMF indicates that the SNSSAI is not available independent of whether the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication or in 5GMMIDLE mode the AMF shall request the SMF to release any PDU session associated with the SNSSAI.
##### 4.6.3.6	Session management for partial network slice
If the SNSSAI is included in the partially allowed NSSAI and
a if the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is allowed the UE may initiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure for the SNSSAI or
b if the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is allowed the UE shall not initiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure for the SNSSAI.
If an existing PDU session is established for the SNSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI and the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which this SNSSAI is allowed
a the UE
1 may initiate the service request procedure to reestablish the user plane resources for the established PDU session or
2 may initiate for the established PDU session either the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.4.5.2.1 case h or the service request procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.6.1.1 case d and
b the SMF may initiate the networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the UE for the established PDU session see subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l.
If an existing PDU session is established for the SNSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI and the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which this SNSSAI is allowed
a the UE
1 shall maintain the 5GSM contexts for the established PDU session
2 shall not initiate for the established PDU session the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.4.5.2.1 case h nor the service request procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.6.1.1 case d
3 shall not attempt to request the establishment of user plane resources for the established PDU session associated with this SNSSAI and
4 shall not initiate any UErequested 5GSM procedure for the established PDU session except
i the UErequested PDU session release procedure or
ii the UErequested PDU session modification procedure to set the 3GPP PS data off status to deactivated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 and
b the SMF
1 shall maintain the 5GSM contexts for the established PDU session
2 shall not initiate the networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the UE for the established PDU session see subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l and
3 may initiate the networkrequested PDU session release procedure for the established PDU session.
If the SMF cannot determine that the UE is located in a TA within the list of TAs associated with the SNSSAI of an existing PDU session established for this SNSSAI the SMF may according to operators policy
a attempt to establish the user plane resources for the PDU session or
b initiate the networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the UE see subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l.
NOTE The session management for partial network slice is not applicable to the PDU session established for onboarding services in SNPN.
##### 4.6.3.7	Session management aspect of handling network slices with NS-AoS not matching deployed tracking areas
If a UE is outside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI for which a PDU session is established see subclause 4.6.2.10 the UE shall not
a attempt to request the establishment of user plane resources of any PDU session associated with this SNSSAI and
b initiate the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.4.5.2.1 case h nor the service request procedure to send CIoT user data to the SMF see subclause 5.6.1.1 case d for the established PDU session.
If a UE is outside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI for which a PDU session is established see subclause 4.6.2.10 the SMF shall not
a attempt to establish user plane resources of any PDU session associated with this SNSSAI and
b initiate the networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the UE see subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l.
If a UE is outside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI for which a PDU session is established see subclause 4.6.2.10 the UE shall not initiate for this PDU session any UErequested 5GSM procedure except
a the UErequested PDU session release procedure or
b the UErequested PDU session modification procedure to set the 3GPP PS data off status to deactivated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 .
NOTE A PDU session associated with an SNSSAI is not released solely because a UE is outside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
If a UE is outside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI see subclause 4.6.2.10 the UE shall not initiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure for this SNSSAI.
If the SMF cannot determine that the UE is located inside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI of an existing PDU session established for this SNSSAI the SMF may according to operators policy
a attempt to establish the user plane resources for this PDU session or
b initiate the networkinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data to the UE for this PDU session see subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l.
#### 4.7.1	General
From the UEs NAS perspective in general the procedures and messages defined for 5GMM and 5GSM are used over non3GPP access as over 3GPP access. However a number of aspects are different as described in the following subclauses.
##### 4.7.2.1	General
The mobility management procedures defined over 3GPP access are reused over non3GPP access with the following exceptions
a the registration status and the 5GMM parameters of the UEs 3GPP access and non3GPP access 5GMM state machine instances are independent in each of these accesses and can be different
b singleregistration mode and dualregistration mode do not apply for 5GMM over non3GPP access
c the RPLMN over non3GPP access can be different from the RPLMN over 3GPP access. The MCC of the RPLMN over 3GPP access and the MCC of the RPLMN over the non3GPP access can also be different
d the registration for 3GPP access and for non3GPP access are performed separately. Like for 3GPP access an access stratum connection exists before the UE can perform the registration procedure for non3GPP access. As at registration over non3GPP access the UE is allocated a registration area which is associated with a single TAI list management of registration areas is not required and registration updating due to registration area change with the registered PLMN is not performed. Furthermore the registration procedure for periodic registration update is also not performed. New registration at change of PLMN is required
e the 5GMM over non3GPP access in the UE considers that the N1 NAS signalling connection is established when the lower layers indicate that the access stratum connection is established succcessfully
f the UEinitiated service request procedure via non3GPP access is supported. Upon indication from the lower layers of non3GPP access that the access stratum connection is established between the UE and the network the UE in 5GMMREGISTERED state and in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access shall initiate the service request procedure via non3GPP access. The UE may indicate with the service request message the PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access to reestablish userplane resources for which the UE has pending user data to be sent
g paging procedure is not performed via non3GPP access
h service area restrictions do not apply for non3GPP access other than the wireline access
i the establishment cause for non3GPP access is determined according to subclause 4.7.2.2
j eCall inactivity procedure is not performed via non3GPP access
k local area data network LADN does not apply for non3GPP access
l the Allowed PDU session status IE shall not be included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message or the SERVICE REQUEST message sent over non3GPP access
m DRX parameters do not apply for non3GPP access
n Mobile initiated connection only mode MICO does not apply for non3GPP access
o CIoT 5GS optimizations do not apply for non3GPP access
p unified access control does not apply for non3GPP access
q UE radio capability signalling optimisation RACS does not apply for non3GPP access
r Closed access group CAG does not apply for non3GPP access
s the N1 NAS signalling connection release the paging indication for voice services and reject the paging request do not apply for non3GPP access. The Paging restriction IE shall not be included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message sent over non3GPP access. The AMF shall not delete any stored paging restriction preferences for the UE and shall not stop restricting paging when receiving REGISTRATION REQUEST message SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message over non3GPP access
t the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI do not apply for non3GPP access
u support for unavailability period see subclause 5.3.26 does not apply for non3GPP access
v disaster roaming services see subclause 4.24 do not apply for non3GPP access and
w RAT utilization control does not apply for non3GPP access.
##### 4.7.2.2	Establishment cause for non-3GPP access
When establishment of an N1 NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access is initiated the UE shall
a determine one or more access identities to be associated with the establishment of the N1 NAS signalling connection as specified in subclause 4.5.2 and table 4.5.2.1
b select the establishment cause for non3GPP access from the determined one or more access identities and the event which triggered initiation of the N1 NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access by checking the rules specified in table 4.7.2.2.1 and
c provide the selected establishment cause for non3GPP access to the lower layers.
While an MMTEL voice call is ongoing
any
1 service request procedure or
2 registration procedure
initiated in 5GMMIDLE mode is mapped to MO MMTel voice call type access attempt.
While an MMTEL video call is ongoing and no MMTEL voice call is ongoing
any
1 service request procedure or
2 registration procedure
initiated in 5GMMIDLE mode is mapped to MO MMTel video call type access attempt.
While an SMSoIP is ongoing no MMTEL video call is ongoing and no MMTEL voice call is ongoing
any
1 service request procedure or
2 registration procedure
initiated in 5GMMIDLE mode is mapped to MO SMS over IP type access attempt.
If the access attempt matches more than one rule the establishment cause for non3GPP access of the lowest rule number shall be used.
Table 4.7.2.2.1 Mapping table for determination of establishment cause for non3GPP access
#### 4.7.3	5GS session management aspects
The session management procedures defined over 3GPP access are reused over non3GPP access with the following exceptions
a Serving PLMN rate control does not apply for non3GPP access
b Small data rate control does not apply for non3GPP access
c Handling of 5GSM cause value #82 maximum data rate per UE for userplane integrity protection is too low does not apply for non3GPP access
d MBS does not apply for non3GPP access
e Support of redundant PDU sessions does not apply for non3GPP access and
f Void
#### 4.7.4	Limited service state over non-3GPP access
There are a number of situations in which the UE is unable to obtain normal service from a PLMN over non3GPP access and the UE enters the limited service state over non3GPP access. These include
a no USIM in the ME
b an illegal UE or illegal ME is received when registration networkinitiated deregistration or service request is performed any USIM in the ME is then considered invalid
c a 5GS services not allowed is received when a registration networkinitiated deregistration or service request is performed
d a PLMN not allowed is received when registration networkinitiated deregistration or service request is performed
e a Tracking area not allowed is received when a registration networkinitiated deregistration or service request is performed
f a Roaming not allowed in this tracking area is received when a registration networkinitiated deregistration or service request is performed
g void or
h a Serving network not authorized is received when a registration or service request is performed.
In limited service state with a valid USIM in the UE the network selection is performed as defined in 3GPP TS 24.502 .
With the exception of performing initial registration for emergency services no registration requests are made until a valid USIM is present. For registration for emergency services the PLMN of the current N3IWF or TNGF is considered as the selected PLMN for the duration the UE is registered for emergency services.
#### 4.7.5	NAS signalling using trusted WLAN access network
A trusted WLAN interworking function TWIF provides functionalities for a non5G capable over WLAN N5CW device to access 5GCN including
a NAS signalling over N1 NAS signalling connection with AMF and
b PDU session establishment modification and release on behalf of the N5CW device over N2 connection with the AMF.
The TWIF registers on behalf of the N5CW device to an AMF according to subclause 5.5.1 by populating the parameters for the registration by using implementation specific default values which are the same for N5CW devices.
The TWIF may request to establish a PDU session as specified in subclause 6.4.1.2 on behalf of the N5CW device upon receipt of an IP configuration request from the N5CW device by populating either all the required parameters or part of the required parameters for the PDU session establishment by using implementation specific default values from the TWIFs configuration. Only one PDU session is supported when N5CW device accessing 5GCN via the TWIF.
NOTE 1 If part of the required parameters for the PDU session establishment is provided by the TWIF the remaining of the required parameters are determined by the AMF or the SMF based on the N5CW devices subscription information.
Upon loss of the IP address of the N5CW device the TWIF acting on behalf of the N5CW device shall initiate the UErequested PDU session release procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.3.
NOTE 2 The established PDU session on behalf of the N5CW device can be modified by the TWIF or the network.
#### 4.8.1	General
In order to interwork with EUTRAN connected to EPC the UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode can operate in singleregistration mode or dualregistration mode see 3GPP TS 23.501 . Support of singleregistration mode is mandatory for UEs supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode.
During the EPS attach procedure see 3GPP TS 24.301 or initial registration procedure see subclause 5.5.1.2 the mode for interworking is selected if the UE supports both S1 mode and N1 mode and the network supports interworking. The mode for interworking may also be selected during the EPS tracking area updating procedure see 3GPP TS 24.301 or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3.
For interworking between EUTRAN connected to EPC and TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN the UE shall operate as specified in either subclause 4.8.2.3 or subclause 4.8.3. Which subclause the UE follows is chosen by the UE irrespective of the interworking without N26 interface indicator.
##### 4.8.2.1	General
If the UE receives the indication that interworking without N26 interface not supported see 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE operates as described in subclause 4.8.2.2.
If the UE receives the indication that interworking without N26 interface supported and
a the UE does not support dualregistration mode or
b the UE supporting dualregistration mode determines to operate in singleregistration mode
the UE operates as described in subclause 4.8.2.3.
##### 4.8.2.2	Single-registration mode with N26 interface
See subclause 5.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and subclause 6.1.4.1 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

1 enter substates EMMDEREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE and 5GMM DEREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE for 3GPP access
NOTE Since MM context transfer is not possible between MME and AMF in a network that indicates Interworking without N26 supported it is up to the UE implementation as to how to keep the 5GMM and EMM states in the UE in sync.
2 map the PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connections as specified in subclause 6.1.4.2 and
3 initiate an EPS attach procedure and include in the ATTACH REQUEST message a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with
the request type set to handover of emergency bearer services to activate a default EPS bearer context for an active emergency PDU session if the session to be transferred is an emergency PDU session or
the request type set to handover message to activate a default EPS bearer context for an active nonemergency PDU session if the session to be transferred is a nonemergency PDU session. If the selected PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.
After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access and the attach attempt counter see 3GPP TS 24.301 enter substates EMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE and 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE for 3GPP access and attempt to activate each of the other default EPS bearer contexts if any by initiating a standalone PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to handover for nonemergency PDU session or handover of emergency bearer services for emergency PDU session in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. If the EPS attach procedure is unsuccessful the UE shall enter substates EMMDEREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE and 5GMMDEREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE for 3GPP access and
b otherwise enter substates EMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE and 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE for 3GPP access and initiate a tracking area update procedure see 3GPP TS 24.301 .

At intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMIDLE mode the UE shall
a enter substate 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE for 3GPP access and substate EMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE
b map the default EPS bearer contexts of the PDN connections which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS if any to the corresponding PDU sessions as specified in subclause 6.1.4.2 and
c initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update over 3GPP access indicating mobility registration updating in the 5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message see subclause 5.5.1.3.
After having successfully registered in N1 mode over 3GPP access the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access and the attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter see 3GPP TS 24.301 and
a if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to existing PDU session or existing emergency PDU session to transfer a PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the UE has received an interworking without N26 interface supported indication from the network attempt to transfer the PDN connections which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS if any from S1 mode to N1 mode by
if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to existing emergency PDU session to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer services and
if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a nonemergency PDN connection initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to
1 MA PDU request if the PDN connection to be transferred is a userplane resource of an MA PDU session or
2 existing PDU session to transfer the nonemergency PDN connection and
b otherwise establish PDU sessions corresponding to the PDN connections which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS if any by initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to initial request.
See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.
###### 4.8.2.3.2	Interworking between TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN and E-UTRAN
If
a the UE has registered in neither N1 mode over 3GPP access nor S1 mode yet and
b the UE has at least one active PDU session associated with non3GPP access which the UE intends to transfer to EPS
the UE shall initiate an EPS attach procedure and include a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a request type in the ATTACH REQUEST message to activate a default EPS bearer context for one of the active PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS see 3GPP TS 24.301 . The request type is set as follows
if the PDU session which the UE intends to transfer is a nonemergency PDU session the request type is set to handover and
if the PDU session which the UE intends to transfer is an emergency PDU session the request type is set to handover of emergency bearer services and the default bearer to be activated is the default EPS bearer context for the emergency PDU session.
NOTE 1 It is necessary for the UE to support sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to handover or handover of emergency bearer services to transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode for interworking between TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN and EUTRAN.
NOTE 2 The order of PDU sessions to be tranferred to EPS is up to UE implementation.
After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure where the activated default EPS bearer context is not for emergency service the UE shall initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to handover for nonemergency PDU session or handover of emergency bearer services for emergency PDU session in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to transfer each of the other PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS if any.
If
a the UE has not registered in N1 mode over non3GPP access yet and
b the UE has at least one active PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN
the UE shall initiate an initial registration procedure over non3GPP access see subclause 5.5.1.2.
After successful completion of the 5GS initial registration in N1 mode over non3GPP access the UE shall initiate a UErequested PDU session establishment procedure with a request type to transfer each of the PDN connections which the UE intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN if any. The request type is set as follows
if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services the request type is set to existing emergency PDU session to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer services and
if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a nonemergency PDN connection the request type is set to existing PDU session to transfer the nonemergency PDN connection.
NOTE 3 If the UE has no active PDU session associated with non3GPP access which the UE in N1 mode intends to transfer to EPS or no active PDN connection associated with 3GPP access which the UE in S1 mode intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN the interworking between TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN and EUTRAN is not supported.
See subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.
#### 4.8.3	Dual-registration mode
If both 5GMM and EMM are enabled a UE operating in the dualregistration mode shall maintain independent contexts for 5GMM and EMM and this includes independent lists of equivalent PLMNs. Coordination between 5GMM and EMM is not needed except as specified in the present subclause subclause 5.1.5 and 5.3.13A.
For dualregistration mode the following applies
a a UE operating in the dualregistration mode may register to N1 mode only S1 mode only or to both N1 mode and S1 mode
b when the UE decides to operate in dualregistration mode see subclause 5.5.1.2.4 NAS informs the lower layers about this
c if a UE is registered in N1 mode only then for registration in S1 mode the UE shall use
1 the same PLMN to which it is registered in N1 mode or
2 an equivalent PLMN and
d if a UE is registered in S1 mode only then for registration in N1 mode the UE shall use
1 the same PLMN to which it is registered in S1 mode or
2 an equivalent PLMN.
NOTE 1 It is up to UE implementation how to handle the case when the UE is registered in both N1 mode and S1 mode and the PLMNs to which the UE is registered are not equivalent e.g. search for a PLMN which is the same or equivalent to any of the registered ones.
When no PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure with PDN connection establishment if EMMREGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the MME. If EMMREGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the MME the UE may initiate either the EPS attach procedure without PDN connection establishment or the attach procedure with PDN connection establishment.
When at least one PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure. If necessary the UE may transfer an active PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the EPS attach procedure with request type set to handover in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. After successfully attached in S1 mode if necessary the UE may transfer other active PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to handover in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
NOTE 2 It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDU session is transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode.
When the UE has not registered to N1 mode the UE may initiate the initial registration procedure. After successfully registered in N1 mode if necessary the UE may transfer one or more active PDN connections from S1 mode to N1 mode by initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to existing PDU session.
NOTE 3 It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDN connection is transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode.
If the MME supports EMMREGISTERED without PDN connection the UE that transferred all PDN connections to the 5GS may stay in state EMMREGISTERED. Otherwise the UE shall enter state EMMDEREGISTERED upon transferring all PDN connection to the 5GS.
NOTE 4 When the UE has registered in both N1 mode and S1 mode it is up to UE implementation to maintain the registration update to date in both N1 mode and S1 mode.
See subclause 6.1.4 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.
See subclause 4.8.2.3.2 for interworking between TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN and EUTRAN.
#### 4.8.4	Core Network selection for UEs not using CIoT 5GS optimizations
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode when the UE needs to use one or more functionalities not supported in 5GS but supported in EPS and the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode the UE may disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access see subclause 4.9.2.
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode and lower layers provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN without also providing an indication that a target core network type was received from the NGRAN the UE shall select a core network type EPC or 5GCN based on the PLMN selection procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 and provide the selected core network type information to the lower layer during the initial registration procedure.
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode and the lower layers have provided an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN and an indication of whether the network supports IMS emergency services via either EPC or 5GCN or both see 3GPP TS 36.331 25A the UE selects a core network type EPC or 5GCN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 subclause H.2 for initiating emergency calls when in the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE or EMMDEREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE.
NOTE 1 If the PLMN selection information provisioned in the USIM does not contain any prioritization between EUTRAN and NGRAN for a PLMN which core network type to select for that PLMN is up to UE implementation.
If the UE is capable of both N1 mode and S1 mode and lower layers provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN with
1 an indication that target core network type EPC was received from the NGRAN the UE shall select the EPC and proceed with the appropriate EMM procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 or
2 an indication that target core network type 5GCN was received from the NGRAN the UE shall select the 5GCN and proceed with the appropriate 5GMM procedure.
NOTE 2 The NGRAN can provide a target core network type to the UE during RRC connection release with redirection see 3GPP TS 36.331 25A and 3GPP TS 38.331 .
##### 4.8.4A.1	Core network selection
A UE that supports CIoT optimizations performs core network selection i.e. it selects EPC or 5GCN if the lower layers have provided an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to both EPC and 5GCN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
When selecting a PLMN as described in 3GPP TS 23.122 the UE shall select a core network type EPC or 5GCN based on
a indication from the lower layers about the CIoT EPS optimizations supported in EPC
b indication from the lower layers about the CIoT 5GS optimizations supported in 5GCN
c the CIoT EPS optimizations supported by the UE
d the CIoT 5GS optimizations supported by the UE
e the UEs preferred CIoT network behaviour for EPC and
f the UEs preferred CIoT network behaviour for 5GCN.
The UE shall provide the selected core network type information to the lower layer during the initial registration procedure.
##### 4.8.4A.2	Redirection of the UE by the core network
The network that supports CIoT optimizations can redirect a UE between EPC and 5GCN as specified in subclause 5.31.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 . The network can take into account the UEs N1 mode capability or S1 mode capability the CIoT network behaviour supported and preferred by the UE or the CIoT network behaviour supported by the network to determine the redirection.
NOTE It is assumed that the network would avoid redirecting the UE back and forth between EPC and 5GCN.
The network redirects the UE to EPC by rejecting the registration request or service request with the 5GMM cause #31 Redirection to EPC required as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.5 5.5.1.3.5 and 5.6.1.5. Upon receipt of reject message the UE disables the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in subclause 4.9.2 and enables the EUTRA capability if it was disabled in order to move to EPC.
When there is no ongoing registration procedure or service request procedure for a UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode if the AMF determines to redirect the UE to EPC the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure to indicate registration requested and release of the N1 NAS signalling connection not requested as described in subclause 5.4.4. The network then redirects the UE to EPC by rejecting the registration request as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.5.
The network that supports CIoT optimizations can also redirect a UE from EPC to 5GCN as specified in subclause 5.3.19.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 .
#### 4.9.1	General
The UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability when the UE powers off and powers on again the USIM is removed or an entry of the list of subscriber data with the SNPN identity of the SNPN is updated.
#### 4.9.2	Disabling and re-enabling of UE's N1 mode capability for 3GPP access
The UE shall only disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when in 5GMMIDLE mode.
When the UE is disabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access for a PLMN not due to redirection to EPC it should proceed as follows
a select an EUTRA cell which is not a restricted RAT as specified in clauses 4.2A connected to EPC or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization select a satellite EUTRA cell connected to EPC via WBEUTRANLEO WBEUTRANMEO or WBEUTRANGEO of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs if the UE supports S1 mode and the UE has not disabled its EUTRA capability as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301
b if an EUTRA cell connected to EPC or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization if a satellite EUTRA cell connected to EPC via WBEUTRANLEO WBEUTRANMEO or WBEUTRANGEO of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found the UE does not support S1 mode or the UE has disabled its EUTRA capability as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE may select another RAT which is not a restricted RAT as specified in clauses 4.2A of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs that the UE supports
c if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of equivalent PLMNs cannot be found then enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH or 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH or the UE does not have a registered PLMN then enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 . If disabling of the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was not due to a UEinitiated deregistration procedure for 5GS services over 3GPP access not due to switchoff the UE may reenable the N1 capability for this PLMN selection. As an implementation option if the UE does not have a registered PLMN instead of performing PLMN selection the UE may select another RAT of the selected PLMN if the UE has chosen a PLMN and the RAT is supported by the UE or
d if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available then
1 if the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was disabled due to IMS voice not available for NGRAN access
if the UE has disabled its EUTRA capability as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE shall reenable both the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and the EUTRA capability in order to remain registered for 5GS services or EPS services in the registered PLMN and how this is done is UE implementation dependent or
if the UE does not support S1 mode the UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and remain registered for 5GS services in NGRAN or satellite NGRAN of the registered PLMN or
2 otherwise the UE may reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and indicate to lower layers to remain camped on NGRAN cell or satellite NGRAN cell of the registered PLMN.
If the UE reenables the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access then it may periodically scan for another PLMN and RAT combination which can provide EPS services or nonEPS services if the UE supports EPS services or nonEPS services. How this periodic scanning is done is UE implementation dependent.
NOTE 0 If EPS services or nonEPS services can be obtained from another PLMN and RAT combination to avoid ping pong the UE can disable the N1 mode capability again.
When the UE is disabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access for an SNPN it should proceed as follows
a enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH or 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform SNPN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 . If disabling of the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was not due to a UEinitiated deregistration procedure for 5GS services over 3GPP access not due to switchoff the UE may reenable the N1 capability for this SNPN selection or
b if no other SNPN is available then the UE may reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and indicate to lower layers to remain camped on NGRAN cell of the registered SNPN.
When the UE is disabling the N1 mode capability upon receiving cause value #31 Redirection to EPC required as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.2.5 5.5.1.3.5 and 5.6.1.5 it should proceed as follows
a If the UE is in NBN1 mode
1 if lower layers do not provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to EPC or lower layers do not provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE search for a suitable NBIoT cell connected to EPC according to 3GPP TS 36.304 25C
2 if lower layers provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to EPC and the current EUTRA cell supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE perform a core network selection to select EPC as specified in subclause 4.8.4A.1 or
3 if lower layers cannot find a suitable NBIoT cell connected to EPC or there is no suitable NBIoT cell connected to EPC which supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE the UE as an implementation option may indicate to lower layers to remain camped on EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN may then start an implementationspecific timer and enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE. The UE may reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the implementationspecific timer if the timer had been started and may then proceed with the appropriate 5GMM procedure.
b If the UE is in WBN1 mode
1 if lower layers do not provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to EPC or lower layers do not provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE search for a suitable EUTRA cell connected to EPC or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization select a satellite EUTRA cell connected to EPC via WBEUTRANLEO WBEUTRANMEO or WBEUTRANGEO according to 3GPP TS 36.304 25C
2 if lower layers provide an indication that the current EUTRA cell is connected to EPC and the current EUTRA cell supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE then perform a core network selection to select EPC as specified in subclause 4.8.4A.1 or
3 if lower layers cannot find a suitable EUTRA cell connected to EPC or if the lower layers cannot find a suitable satellite EUTRA cell via WBEUTRANLEO WBEUTRANMEO or WBEUTRANGEO or there is no suitable EUTRA cell connected to EPC or there is no suitable satellite EUTRA cell connected to EPC via WBEUTRANLEO WBEUTRANMEO or WBEUTRANGEO which supports CIoT EPS optimizations that are supported by the UE the UE as an implementation option may indicate to lower layers to remain camped on EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN may then start an implementationspecific timer and enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE. The UE may reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the implementationspecific timer if the timer had been started and may then proceed with the appropriate 5GMM procedure.
When the UE supporting both N1 mode and S1 mode needs to stay in EUTRA connected to EPC e.g. due to the domain selection for UE originating sessions as specified in subclause 4.3.2 in order to prevent unintentional handover or cell reselection from EUTRA connected to EPC to NGRAN connected to 5GCN the UE operating in singleregistration mode shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and
a shall set the N1mode bit to N1 mode for 3GPP access not supported in the UE network capability IE see 3GPP TS 24.301 of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in EPC and
b the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layers of disabling of the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access.
If the UE is required to disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and select EUTRA or another RAT and the UE is in the 5GMMCONNECTED mode
if the UE has a persistent PDU session then the UE waits until the radio bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released
otherwise the UE shall locally release the established NAS signalling connection
and enter the 5GMMIDLE mode before selecting EUTRA or another RAT.
If the UE is disabling its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access before selecting EUTRA or another RAT the UE shall not perform the UEinitiated deregistration procedure of subclause 5.5.2.2.
The UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when the UE performs PLMN selection SNPN selection or SNPN selection for onboarding services over 3GPP access unless
a disabling of the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was due to a UEinitiated deregistration procedure for 5GS services over 3GPP access not due to switchoff
b the UE has already reenabled the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when performing items c or d above or
c the UE disables the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access for cases described in subclauses 5.5.1.2.7 and 5.5.1.3.7.
If the disabling of N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was due to IMS voice is not available over NGRAN access and the UEs usage setting is voice centric the UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when the UEs usage setting is changed from voice centric to data centric as specified in subclauses 4.3.3.
The UE should memorize the identity of the PLMN or SNPN where N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was disabled and should use that stored information in subsequent PLMN or SNPN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 .
If the disabling of N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was due to successful completion of an emergency services fallback the criteria to enable the N1 mode capability again are UE implementation specific.
The UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if requested by the upper layers e.g. see subclause U.2.2.6.4 in 3GPP TS 24.229 . If the UE disabled the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access based on the request from the upper layers e.g. see subclause U.2.2.6.4 in 3GPP TS 24.229 the criteria to reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access after the completion of an emergency service are UE implementation specific.
If the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was disabled due to the UE initiated deregistration procedure for 3GPP access or for 3GPP access and non3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode see subclause 5.5.2.2.3 upon request of the upper layers to reregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access or the UE needs to come out of unavailability period and resume normal services the UE shall enable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access again.
As an implementation option the UE may start a timer for enabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when the UE disables the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access. The UE should memorize the identity of the PLMNs or SNPNs where N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was disabled. On expiry of this timer
a if the UE is in Iu mode or AGb mode and is in idle mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 the UE should enable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access
b if the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no RR connection exists the UE may abort the PS signalling connection before enabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access
c if the UE is in S1 mode and is in EMMIDLE mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE should enable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and
d If the UE is in Iu mode or AGb mode and an RR connection exists the UE should delay enabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access until the RR connection is released. If the UE is in S1 mode and is in EMMCONNECTED mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE should delay enabling the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access until the NAS signalling connection in S1 mode is released.
When the UE enables the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access the UE shall remove the PLMN or SNPN from the memorized identity of the PLMNs or SNPNs where N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was disabled.
NOTE 1 As described in 3GPP TS 23.122 if the UE is in automatic PLMN selection mode or automatic SNPN selection mode the UE does not consider the memorized PLMNs as PLMN selection candidates for NGRAN access technology or satellite NGRAN access technology or the memorized SNPN as SNPN selection candidates till the timer expires.
If the N1 mode was disabled for a particular PLMN due to no available slice in that PLMN and the timer T3526 has expired then the UE may reenable the N1 mode for the PLMN and start a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with a requested NSSAI containing the SNSSAI for which the associated T3526 has expired. In this case the UE shall stop the timer TNSU for the PLMN and remove the PLMN ID from the memorized identity of the PLMNs where N1 mode is disabled due to no available network slices.
The UE may disable the N1 mode capability for currently camped PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP access see 3GPP TS 23.122 if no network slice is available for the camped PLMN or SNPN see subclauses 5.5.1.2.5 and 5.5.1.3.5. If the disabling of N1 mode capability for 3GPP access was due to no network slices available the UE should memorize the identity of the PLMN or SNPN where N1 mode is disabled due to no available network slices or the list of SNPNs where N1 mode is disabled due to no available network slices respectively. As an implementation option the UE may start a timer TNSU for enabling the N1 mode capability that was disabled due to no available network slices for the 3GPP access. The value of timer TNSU is UE implementation specific. The UE should remove the memorized identity of the PLMNs or SNPNs where N1 mode is disabled due to no available network slice upon
a the expiry of the timer TNSU or
b receiving REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message containing the Network slicing indication IE with the Network slicing subscription change indication set to “Network slicing subscription changed”.
NOTE 1A If a network slice is temporarily unavailable to the UE due to the SNSSAI time validity information or the SNSSAI location validity information as described in subclauses 4.6.2.8 and 4.6.2.10 respectively and no other network slice is available to the UE for the camped PLMN or SNPN as an implementation option the UE can keep the N1 mode capability enabled for currently camped PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP access.
If the UE receives ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message provided with SNSSAI and the PLMN ID in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE see subclause 6.5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE may remove the PLMN ID from the memorized identity of the PLMNs where N1 mode is disabled due to no available network slices.
If the UE attempts to establish an emergency PDU session in a PLMN or SNPN where N1 mode capability was disabled due to the UEs registration attempt counter have reached 5 the UE may enable N1 mode capability for that PLMN memorized by the UE.
NOTE 2 If N1 mode capability is disabled due to the UEs registration attempt counter reaches 5 the value of the timer for reenabling N1 mode capability is recommended to be the same as the value of T3502 which follows the handling specified in subclause 5.3.8. If the value of T3502 is indicated as zero by the network an implementation specific nonzero value can be used for the timer for reenabling N1 mode capability.
If the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN and access for localized services in SNPN is enabled then
the UE may reenable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if disabled for that SNPN when
1 the validity information of the SNPN contained in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN changes from not met to met or
2 the validity information of a GIN broadcasted by an SNPN contained in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN changes from not met to met and
the UE need not reenable N1 mode capability for 3GPP access for that SNPN if the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access for that SNPN was disabled due to 5GMM cause value #27 N1 mode not allowed.
NOTE 3 If the UE receives a reject message with a 5GMM cause value and the N1 mode capability is disabled again for the SNPN it is up to UE implementation whether to reenable N1 mode capability for the SNPN if the validity information of the SNPN is still met.
#### 4.9.3	Disabling and re-enabling of UE's N1 mode capability for non-3GPP access
When the UE disables the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access the UE NAS layer shall not initiate any 5GS NAS procedures towards the network over non3GPP access.
When the UE supporting both N1 mode and S1 mode needs to stay in non3GPP access connected to EPC e.g. due to the domain selection for UE originating sessions as specified in subclause 4.3.2 in order to prevent unintentional selection of a non3GPP access network connected to 5GCN the UE operating in singleregistration mode shall not transfer any PDN connection to a non3GPP access network connected to the 5GCN.
If the disabling of N1 mode capability for non3GPP access was due to IMS voice is not available over non3GPP access in 5GS and the UEs usage setting is voice centric the UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access when the UEs usage setting is changed from voice centric to data centric as specified in subclauses 4.3.3.
The UE shall reenable the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access when a new PLMN or SNPN is selected over non3GPP access.
The UE may disable the N1 mode capability for the currently camped PLMN or SNPN over non3GPP access if no network slice is available for the camped PLMN or SNPN.
As an implementation option the UE may start a timer for reenabling the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access after the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access was disabled. On the expiry of this timer the UE should reenable the N1 mode capability for non3GPP access.
#### 4.9.4	Disabling and re-enabling of UE's satellite NG-RAN capability
Disable of the satellite NGRAN capability shall only be performed when the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode.
When disabling the satellite NGRAN capability the UE
a may disable the NR NTN access capability see 3GPP TS 38.304 and 3GPP TS 38.306 28A
b shall memorize the identity of the PLMN where the satellite NGRAN capability was disabled and
c shall use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 .
NOTE As an implementation option the UE can disable satellite NGRAN capability by disabling N1 mode capability for satellite NGRAN access.
As an implementation option the UE may start a timer for enabling satellite NGRAN capability and on expiry of this timer UE shall remove the PLMN from the memorized identity of the PLMNs where the satellite NGRAN capability was disabled.
If the disabling of satellite NGRAN capability was due to IMS voice is not available and the UEs usage setting is voice centric the UE shall reenable the satellite NGRAN capability when the UEs usage setting is changed from voice centric to data centric as specified in subclauses 4.3.3.
### 4.10	Interworking with ePDG connected to EPC
In order to interwork with ePDG connected to EPC the UE shall operate as specified in either subclause 4.8.2.3 or subclause 4.8.3. Which subclause the UE follows is chosen by the UE irrespective of the interworking without N26 interface indicator.
The UE shall not attempt to transfer PDU sessions with PDU session type Ethernet or Unstructured to an ePDG connected to EPC.
NOTE 1 PDU sessions with PDU session type Ethernet or Unstructured cannot be transferred to an ePDG connected to EPC because PDN connections with PDN type nonIP or PDN type Ethernet are not supported over ePDG connected to EPC.
The UE shall not attempt to transfer PDU sessions with the selected SSC mode set to SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3 to an ePDG connected to EPC.
### 4.11	UE configuration parameter updates
The 5GS in a PLMN supports updating UE parameters via NAS signalling. The feature enables the HPLMN to securely and dynamically reconfigure the UE configuration parameters stored on the USIM and the ME.
In this release of the specification updates of the following USIM configuration parameters are supported
routing indicator.
In this release of specification updates of the following ME configuration parameters are supported
default configured NSSAI.
disaster roaming information.
The 5GS in an SNPN supports updating UE parameters via NAS signalling. The feature enables the SNPN to securely and dynamically reconfigure the UE configuration parameter stored on the USIM if the UE used the USIM for registration to the SNPN.
In this release of the specification updates of the following USIM configuration parameters are supported
routing indicator.
In this release of specification updates of the following ME configuration parameters are supported
routing indicator.
default configured NSSAI.
The update of UE configuration parameters is initiated by the network using the networkinitiated downlink NAS transport procedure as described in subclause 5.4.5.3. The ME acknowledgement of successful reception of the updated UE configuration parameter information is sent back to the network using the UEinitiated uplink NAS transport procedure as described in subclause 5.4.5.2.
### 4.12	Access traffic steering, switching and splitting (ATSSS)
The ATSSS feature is an optional feature that may be supported by the UE and the 5GCN.
The ATSSS feature enables a multiaccess PDU connectivity service which can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network and one non3GPP access network. The multiaccess PDU connectivity service is realized by establishing a multiaccess PDU session i.e. a PDU session that can have userplane resources on two access networks.
NOTE 1 MA PDU session is not applicable for CIoT 5GS optimization in this release of specification.
The UE can request an MA PDU session when the UE is registered via both 3GPP and non3GPP accesses or when the UE is registered via one access only. The MA PDU session management is performed based on the PDU session management procedures.
The detailed description of the procedures for ATSSS between the UE and the network across one 3GPP access network and one non3GPP access network are specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 13B.
NOTE 2 In this version of the specification PDU set handling is not supported in an MA PDU session.
### 4.13	Support of NAS signalling using wireline access network
A 5GRG a WAGF acting on behalf of an FNRG or a WAGF acting on behalf of an N5GC device can use wireline access network to access the 5GCN by using NAS signalling procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 3GPP TS 23.502 and 3GPP TS 23.316 6D.
Wireline access is a type of non3GPP access.
A 5GRG simultaneously connected to the same 5GCN of a PLMN over a 3GPP access and a wireline access is connected to a single AMF.
5GRG maintains the N1 NAS signalling connection with the AMF over the wireline access network after all the PDU sessions for the 5GRG over that access have been released or handed over to 3GPP access.
The 5GRG connected to 5GCN via NGRAN is specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D.
When accessing the 5GCN over 3GPP access in addition to requirements specified for the 5GRG in the present document the 5GRG shall also perform requirements e.g 5GMM 5GSM related requirements specified in the present document for a UE accessing 5GCN over 3GPP access. When accessing the 5GCN over wireline access in addition to requirements specified for the 5GRG in the present document the 5GRG shall also perform requirements e.g 5GMM 5GSM related requirements specified in the present document for a UE accessing 5GCN over non3GPP access. If a requirement specified for the 5GRG in the present document contradicts a requirement specified for the UE in the present document the 5GRG shall perform the requirement specified in the present document for the 5GRG.
For the scenario of FNRG which does not support N1 mode the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG exchanges NAS signalling messages with an AMF.
For the scenario of N5GC device which does not support N1 mode the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device exchanges NAS signalling messages with an AMF.
For the scenario of AUN3 device which does not support N1 mode the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device exchanges NAS signalling messages with an AMF. If the 5GRG is not registered and connected to the 5GCN over wireline access the 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device shall not initiate the initial registration procedure on behalf of the AUN3 device.
NOTE 1 The 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device maintains a 5GMM context for each AUN3 device behind it. The AMF maintains a 5GMM context for each AUN3 device. The AMF is not aware of any association between the 5GMM context of the 5GRG and the 5GMM context of the AUN3 device.
When the 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device initiates the initial registration procedure on behalf of the AUN3 device the 5GRG shall not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
For the scenario of NAUN3 device which does not support N1 mode the 5GRG acting on behalf of a connectivity group consisting of one or more NAUN3 devices exchanges NAS signalling messages with an AMF.
NOTE 2 It is also possible for 5GRG that is connected to 5GCN via NGRAN to act on behalf of a connectivity group consisting of one or more NAUN3 devices as specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D.
In addition to requirements specified for the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device in the present document the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall also perform requirements specified in the present document for a UE accessing 5GCN over non3GPP access. If a requirement specified for the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device in the present document contradicts a requirement specified for the UE in the present document the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall perform requirement specified in the present document for the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device.
The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is not supported in a PDU session established by the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device.
The WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device requests the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the N5GC device upon registration. Only one PDU session per N5GC device is supported.
The 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device requests the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the AUN3 device upon registration. Only one PDU session per AUN3 is supported.
The 5GRG acting on behalf of a connectivity group consisting of one or more NAUN3 devices requests the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the connectivity group. Only one PDU session per the connectivity group is supported where all the NAUN3 devices in the connectivity group share the same PDU session.
A 5GRG or an FNRG provide a non3GPP access network to UEs. A UE connected to a non3GPP access network provided by the 5GRG or the FNRG can access to the 5GCN via the N3IWF or via the TNGF as described in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D.
The 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG shall indicate ANDSP not supported by the UE in the UE policy classmark IE during the UEinitiated UE state indication procedure as specified in subclause D.2.2.
The 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG shall indicate Reporting URSP rule enforcement not supported by the UE in the UE policy classmark IE during the UEinitiated UE state indication procedure as specified in subclause D.2.2.
The Non3GPP QoS Assistance Information N3QAI is introduced to enable a 5GRG to perform the QoS differentiation for the UE behind the 5GRG the AUN3 device behind the 5GRG or the NAUN3 device behind the 5GRG. The network may provide the N3QAI associated with the QoS flow during the PDU session establishment procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.1 or during the PDU session modification procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.2.
NOTE 3 How the 5GRG applies N3QAI is outside the scope of the present document.
If the AMF receives an indication from the WAGF that there is no 5GRG connected to the same wireline for an AUN3 device as specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D the AMF shall locally deregister the AUN3 device.
#### 4.14.1	General
Two types of NPN can be deployed using 5GS SNPN see subclause 4.14.2 and PNINPN see subclause 4.14.3.
#### 4.14.2	Stand-alone non-public network (SNPN)
If the UE is not SNPN enabled the UE is always considered to be not operating in SNPN access operation mode. If the UE is SNPN enabled the UE can operate in SNPN access operation mode. Details of activation and deactivation of SNPN access operation mode at the SNPNenabled UE are up to UE implementation.
The functions and procedures of NAS described in the present document are applicable to an SNPN and an SNPNenabled UE unless indicated otherwise. The key differences brought by the SNPN to the NAS layer are as follows
a instead of the PLMN selection process the SNPN selection process is performed by a UE operating in SNPN access operation mode see 3GPP TS 23.122 and 3GPP TS 24.502 for further details on the SNPN selection
b a permanently forbidden SNPNs list and a temporarily forbidden SNPNs list are managed per access type independently i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both per entry of the list of subscriber data or if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder per the PLMN subscription by a UE operating in SNPN access operation mode instead of forbidden PLMN lists. If the UE supports onboarding services in SNPN an additional permanently forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN list and an additional temporarily forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN list are managed. If the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN an additional permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list and an additional temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list per entry of the list of subscriber data and per the PLMN subscription are managed for 3GPP access only. These lists shall be maintained across activation and deactivation of SNPN access operation mode
NOTE 0 On timer T3245 expiry when the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder using PLMN subscription and the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode as an implementation option the UE can delete the list of temporarily forbidden SNPNs and permanently forbidden SNPNs and additionally the list of permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN and list of temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN if the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
NOTE 0a If an SNSSAI dedicated by the SNPN to provide access to localized services in SNPN is used then network slicebased cell reselection see 3GPP TS 23.501 can be used to steer the UE to camp on a cell of TAs where the localized services in SNPN are available.
c intersystem change to and from S1 mode is not supported
d void
e CAG is not supported in SNPN access operation mode
f with respect to the 5GMM cause values
1 5GMM cause values #74 Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN and #75 Permanently not authorized for this SNPN are supported whereas these 5GMM cause values cannot be used in a PLMN and
2 5GMM cause values #11 PLMN not allowed #31 Redirection to EPC required #73 Serving network not authorized and #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only are not supported whereas these 5GMM cause values can be used in a PLMN
g a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming and a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service are managed per SNPN and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both entry of the list of subscriber data or if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holderPLMN subscription see 3GPP TS 23.122
h when accessing SNPN services via a PLMN using 3GPP access access to 5GCN of the SNPN is performed using 5GMM procedures for non3GPP access 5GMM parameters for non3GPP access the UE is performing access to SNPN over non3GPP access and the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access. When accessing PLMN services via a SNPN using 3GPP access access to 5GCN of the PLMN is performed using 5GMM procedures for non3GPP access 5GMM parameters for non3GPP access the UE is not performing access to SNPN over non3GPP access and the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access. From the UEs NAS perspective accessing PLMN services via an SNPN and accessing SNPN services via a PLMN are treated as untrusted non3GPP access. If the UE is accessing the PLMN using non3GPP access the access to 5GCN of the SNPN via PLMN is not specified in this release of the specification.
Emergency services are not supported in an SNPN when a UE accesses SNPN services via a PLMN
i when registered to an SNPN the UE shall use only the UE policies provided by the registered SNPN
j inclusion of a TAI of an SNPN other than the registered SNPN into the registration area is not supported. The AMF of an SNPN shall only include into the registration area one or more TAIs of the registered SNPN
j1 inclusion of a TAI of an SNPN other than the registered SNPN into the LADN service area is not supported. The AMF of an SNPN shall only include one or more TAIs of the registered SNPN into the LADN service area
j2 inclusion of a TAI of an SNPN other than the registered SNPN into the allowed area or the nonallowed area of the 3GPP access service area restrictions is not supported.

k void
l void
m UE mobility between SNPNs in 5GMMCONNECTED mode is supported when the SNPNs are equivalent SNPNs for the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. UE mobility between SNPNs in 5GMMIDLE mode is supported when the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder or when the SNPNs are equivalent SNPNs or both for the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription. UE mobility between an SNPN and a PLMN is not supported
n CIoT 5GS optimizations are not supported
o void
p when registering or registered to an SNPN the UE shall handle the 5GS mobile identity as described in subclause 5.5.1.2.2
q when registering or registered to an SNPN the UE shall only consider
1 a last visited registered TAI visited in the same SNPN as an available last visited registered TAI or
2 a last visited registered TAI visited using the same entry of the list of subscriber data or the same PLMN subscription as an available last visited registered TAI if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both
NOTE 1 If the last visited registered TAI is assigned by an SNPN other than the current SNPN the serving AMF can determine the SNPN assigning the last visited registered TAI using the NID provided by the UE.
r emergency service fallback is not supported

u the UE can access an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed using default UE credentials for primary authentication in order for the UE to be configured with one or more entries of the list of subscriber data
x eCall over IMS is not supported in SNPN access operation mode and the UE ignores any USIM configuration for eCall only mode
y when registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN the AMF shall store in the 5GMM context of the UE an indication that the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN
z a UE with multiple valid entries of list of subscriber data or one or more valid USIMs and one or more valid entries of list of subscriber data capable of initiating and maintaining simultaneous separate registration states over 3GPP access with PLMNs or SNPNs using identities and credentials associated with those entries of list of subscriber data or USIMs and entries of list of subscriber data and supporting one or more of the N1 NAS signalling connection release the paging indication for voice services the reject paging request the paging restriction and the paging timing collision control may use procedures defined for MUSIM UE even if the UE does not include multiple valid USIMs
za when the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN the network slice admission control is not performed
NOTE 2 If the network determines that the UE cannot register to the onboarding SNPN due to lack of resources for the network slice used for onboarding the AMF can reject the UE with 5GMM cause #22 congestion.
zb when the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN as specified in subclause 3.1 the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number and emergency services are not supported in the SNPN the UE shall perform a local deregistration and utilize the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 and 3GPP TS 24.229 to select a domain for the emergency session attempt
NOTE 3 The UE can select PS domain for emergency session attempt.

#### 4.14.3	Public network integrated non-public network (PNI-NPN)
A PNINPN is made available by means of e.g. dedicated DNNs or by one or more SNSSAIs allocated for it. A CAG can be optionally used in order to prevent UEs not allowed to access a PNINPN from accessing the PNINPN. The key enablers for the CAG in the NAS layer are as follows
a CAG selection see 3GPP TS 23.122 and
b provisioning of a CAG information list as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 from network to UE via the generic UE configuration update procedure the registration procedure the service request procedure and the networkinitiated deregistration procedure.
The CAG information list provisioned by the network if available is stored in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C. The CAG information list stored in the ME is kept when the UE enters 5GMMDEREGISTERED state. Annex C specifies condition under which the CAG information list stored in the ME is deleted. Additionally when a USIM is inserted if
no CAG information list is stored in the nonvolatile memory of the ME or
the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the CAG information list in the nonvolatile memory of the ME
and the UE has a CAG information list stored in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 the UE shall store the CAG information list from the USIM into the ME as specified in annex C. The Allowed CAG list included in the entry for the HPLMN or EHPLMN in CAG information list stored in the USIM can contain a range of CAGIDs.
The UE supporting CAG may perform the initial registration for emergency services via a nonCAG cell in a PLMN for which the UE has an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells or via a CAG cell for which none of CAGIDs is authorized based on the Allowed CAG list see 3GPP TS 23.122 for the selected PLMN. If a UE supporting CAG having an emergency PDU session is camping on
a a CAG cell and none of the CAGIDs of the CAG cell is authorized based on the Allowed CAG list for the current PLMN in the UEs subscription or
b a nonCAG cell in a PLMN for which the UEs subscription contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells
the AMF shall behave as specified in subclause 5.4.4.2 5.5.1.3.4 or 5.6.1.4.1.
NOTE The emergency services in a PLMN for which the UEs subscription contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells can be subject to local regulation.
If a UE supporting enhanced CAG information is in a CAG cell with a CAGID which
a was authorized based on the Allowed CAG list associated with the current PLMN in the CAG information list stored in the ME and

#### 4.15.1	General
A 5GS can support time synchronization and TSC see 3GPP TS 23.501 3GPP TS 23.502 and 3GPP TS 23.503 . This subclause describes NASspecific aspects of the 5GS features to support time synchronization and TSC. Interworking with EPS is not supported for a PDU session for time synchronization or TSC.
#### 4.15.3	Time synchronization
Two types of synchronization processes are supported by the 5GS 5GS synchronization and gPTP domain synchronization see 3GPP TS 23.501 .
For 5GS synchronization the lower layers provide the 5G internal system clock signalled via the NGRAN see 3GPP TS 38.331 and the UE forwards the 5G internal system clock to the DSTTs.
For gPTP domain synchronization the UE supports forwarding gPTP messages see 3GPP TS 23.501 3GPP TS 23.502 and 3GPP TS 24.535 19A. For all gPTP domains associated with a PDU session
a if the UE receives gPTP message via the PDU session the UE forwards the gPTP messages to the DSTT associated with the PDU session or
b if the UE receives gPTP messages from the DSTT associated with the PDU session the UE forwards the gPTP messages via the PDU session.
Depending on the 5G access stratumbased time distribution or gPTPbased time distribution the network timing synchronization status of the nodes involved in the operation e.g. NGRAN nodes NWTTs may change. Using the 5GMM protocol the network can request a supporting UE to reconnect to the network upon receiving an indication of a change in the RAN timing synchronization status.
#### 4.15.4	User plane node management
A 5G system 5GS can act as a user plane node of an external network e.g. IEEE TSN bridge or a 5GS can be independently used to enable TSC. For these purposes information available at a UE is provided to the network and port management information containers are exchanged between a DSTT and a TSN AF or a TSCTSF see 3GPP TS 24.539 19BA.
During a UErequested PDU session establishment procedure if the UE supports transfer of port management information containers then the UE indicates that transfer of port management information container is supported and the UE provides a DSTT Ethernet port MAC address if the PDU session type is Ethernet port management information container and a UEDSTT residence time if available to the network see subclause 6.4.1.2.
Once the UE has successfully established a PDU session and the UE has indicated that transfer of port management information container is supported during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure see subclause 6.4.1.2 then port management information containers are exchanged via a UErequested PDU session modification procedure and a networkrequested PDU session modification procedure see subclauses 6.3.2 and 6.4.2. The UE receiving a port management information container from the network shall forward the port management information container to the DSTT. The SMF receiving a port management information container from the UE shall operate as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 .
### 4.16	UE radio capability signalling optimisation
UE radio capability signalling optimisation RACS is a feature that is optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface see 3GPP TS 23.501 . RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either manufacturerassigned or networkassigned. The UE radio capability ID is an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container over the radio interface.
In this release of the specification RACS is applicable to neither NBN1 mode nor non3GPP access.
If the UE supports RACS
a the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to RACS supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message

If both a networkassigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturerassigned UE Radio Capability ID are applicable the UE shall include the networkassigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
c if the radio configuration at the UE changes for instance because the UE has disabled a specific radio capability then
1 if the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE radio configuration the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update. The UE shall include the applicable UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall include the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit set to UE radio capability update needed. If both a networkassigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturerassigned UE Radio Capability ID are applicable the UE shall include the networkassigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and
2 if the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE radio configuration the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and include the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit set to UE radio capability update needed
NOTE Performing the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and including the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit set to UE radio capability update needed without a UE radio capability ID included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message can trigger the network to assign a new UE radio capability ID to the UE.
d upon receiving a networkassigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the UE shall store the networkassigned UE radio capability ID and the PLMN ID or SNPN identity of the serving network and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription along with a mapping to the current UE radio configuration in its nonvolatile memory as specified in annex C. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16 received networkassigned UE radio capability IDs with the associated PLMN ID or SNPN identity and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio configuration
e the UE shall not use a networkassigned UE radio capability ID assigned by a PLMN in PLMNs equivalent to the PLMN which assigned it or by an SNPN in SNPNs equivalent to the SNPN which assigned it
f upon receiving a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to Networkassigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the UE shall delete all networkassigned UE radio capability IDs stored at the UE for the serving network initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and include an applicable manufacturerassigned UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration if available at the UE in the UE radio capability ID IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and
g if the UE performs a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update due to entering a tracking area that is not in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a noncleartext IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a networkassigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturerassigned UE Radio Capability ID are applicable the UE shall include the networkassigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the network supports RACS
a the network may assign a networkassigned UE radio capability ID to a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message
b the network may trigger the UE to delete all networkassigned UE radio capability IDs stored at the UE for the serving network by including a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to Networkassigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and
c the network may send an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE that supports RACS to retrieve the PEI if not available in the network.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be recalculated until the NAS procedure is completed restarted or aborted.
4.21 Authentication and Key Management for Applications AKMA
The UE may support AKMA.
The purpose of AKMA is to provide authentication and key management to applications based on 3GPP credentials used for 5GS access as specified in 3GPP TS 33.535 24A which allows the UE to securely exchange data with an AKMA application function.
Upon receiving a request from the upper layers to obtain AKMA Anchor Key KAKMA and AKMA Key Identifier AKID the UE supporting AKMA shall derive the KAKMA and the AKMA Temporary Identifier ATID from the valid KAUSF if available as specified in 3GPP TS 33.535 24A shall further derive the AKID from the ATID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.535 24A and shall provide KAKMA and AKID to the upper layers.
The UE supporting AKMA shall notify the upper layers whenever there is a change of the KAUSF upon reception of an EAPsuccess message in subclauses 5.4.1.2.2.8 5.4.1.2.3.1 and 5.4.1.2.3A.1 or upon reception of SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in subclauses 5.4.2.3.
During an ongoing primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1 if the UE receives a request from upper layers to obtain KAKMA and AKID the UE shall derive the KAKMA and ATID after the completion of the ongoing primary authentication and key agreement procedure shall further derive the AKID from the ATID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.535 24A and shall provide KAKMA and AKID to the upper layers.
NOTE 1 The upper layers derive the AKMA Application Key KAF from KAKMA as specified in 3GPP TS 33.535 24A.
NOTE 2 The knowledge of whether a certain application needs to use AKMA or not is application specific and is out of the scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 3 The exact method of securing the data exchange at the upper layers using KAF is application specific and is out of the scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 4 The upper layers request the UE NAS layer to provide KAKMA and AKID before the upper layers initiate communication with an AKMA application function.
NOTE 5 Upon receiving a request from the upper layers to obtain KAKMA and AKID if there is no KAUSF available the UE NAS layer cannot derive the KAKMA and AKID and provides an indication to the upper layers that KAKMA and AKID cannot be generated.
4.22 Uncrewed aerial vehicle identification authentication and authorization
#### 4.22.1	General
A 5GS can support UAV identification authentication and authorization see 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB. This subclause describes NASspecific aspects of the 5GS features to support UAV identification authentication authorization and C2 communication authorization.
Before accessing 5GS for UAS services the UE supporting UAS services must have an assigned CAAlevel UAV ID. The UE can be registered to 5GS for UAS services if there is a valid aerial subscription in the UEs subscription.
#### 4.22.2	Authentication and authorization of UAV
The 5GS supports the USS UAV Authorization and Authentication UUAA procedure for a UE supporting UAS services. Depending on operator policy or regulatory requirements the UUAAMM procedure can be performed by the UE and the AMF at a registration procedure as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2 the UUAASM procedure can be performed by the UE and the SMF at a PDU session establishment procedure as specified in subclause 6.4.1.2 or both can be performed. The UE shall support UUAAMM and UUAASM and the network shall support UUAASM and may optionally support UUAAMM. The UUAA procedure needs to be performed by 5GS with USS successfully before the connectivity for UAS services is established.
During the registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2 the UE supporting UAS services provides CAAlevel UAV ID to the AMF and the AMF may trigger the UUAAMM procedure. If the UE supporting UAS services does not provide CAAlevel UAV ID to the AMF and the network is configured to perform UUAAMM at registration procedure the AMF may accept the registration request and shall mark in the UEs 5GMM context that the UE is not allowed to request UAS services. If the UE wants to use the UAS services by providing the CAALevel UAV ID later on the UE shall perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.
When a UE supporting UAS services requests to establish a PDU session as described in subclause 6.4.1.2 for USS communication the UE provides CAAlevel UAV ID to the network and the SMF may trigger the UUAASM procedure based on the DNN and SNSSAI combination for aerial services according to the users subscription data and the CAAlevel UAV ID provided by the UE.
If the UE does not provide CAAlevel UAV ID and the user’s subscription data for the UE requires the UUAASM the network rejects the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure for the UAS services.
The UE supporting UAS services shall not provide CAAlevel UAV ID to the network over non3GPP access and the network shall not perform UUAA procedure for non3GPP access and shall ensure that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial services in non3GPP access.
If provided by the upper layers the UE supporting UAS services provides to the network the USS address during the registration procedure or PDU session establishment procedure so that the network uses the information to discover the USS.
NOTE 1 Based on the current location of the UAV upper layers can select the USS address from the list of USS addresses where each entry contains a USS address and a corresponding geographical area.
NOTE 2 The parameters e.g. CAAlevel UAV ID or USS address sent by a UE supporting UAS services to the network for UAS services are included in the ServicelevelAA container IE which is a noncleartext IE.
After successful UUAA procedure either the AMF or the SMF may initiate reauthentication of the UAV when required by the USS. If UUAAMM fails during a reauthentication and there are PDU sessions established using UAS services the AMF shall request the SMF to perform the release of these PDU sessions and may trigger a networkinitiated deregistration procedure based on operator policy. If UUAASM fails during a reauthentication the SMF shall release the PDU session related to reauthentication.
If the UUAA is revoked the PDU session related to the UAS services shall be released by the SMF. Based on operator policy the AMF may decide to keep the UE registered or trigger a deregistration procedure.
#### 4.22.3	Authorization of C2 communication
The 5GS supports USS authorization of C2 communication for pairing of UAV and UAVC. The pairing of UAV and UAVC needs to be authorized by USS successfully before the user plane connectivity for C2 communication over Uu or over NRPC5 is enabled. For C2 authorization procedure the UE supporting UAS services provides to the network with CAAlevel UAV ID.
The USS authorization of UAV flight can also be performed during the C2 authorization procedure. The UE supporting UAS services provides the UAV flight authorization information to the network if provided by upper layers.
NOTE 1 The C2 authorization payload in the servicelevelAA payload can include one some or all of the pairing information for C2 communication an indication of the request for direct C2 communication pairing information for direct C2 communication and the UAV flight authorization information see subclauses 6.4.1.2 and 6.4.2.2.
The UE supporting UAS services can establish a PDU session for the C2 communication by providing the CAAlevel UAV ID and the C2 authorization payload. The SMF upon reception of the UEs request for the PDU session establishment determines that authorization is required based on the DNN and SNSSAI combination of the PDU session is for aerial services according to users subscription data and the CAAlevel UAV ID included in the request.
If a UE supporting UAS services uses a common PDU session for both USS communication and C2 communication the C2 communication can be authorized using UUAASM procedure during the PDU session establishment procedure or during the PDU session modification procedure. If the pairing of UAV and UAVC is revoked the network shall disable C2 communication for the PDU session. The SMF upon reception of the UEs request for the PDU session establishment determines that authorization is required based on the DNN and SNSSAI combination of the PDU session is for aerial services according to users subscription data and the CAAlevel UAV ID included in the request.
NOTE 2 The network can disable C2 communication for the PDU session e.g. by removing the QoS flow for C2 communication during PDU session modification procedure as decribed in subclauses 6.3.2.2.
If a UE supporting UAS services uses separate PDU sessions for respectively USS communication and C2 communication the C2 communication is authorized using UUAASM during the PDU session establishment procedure. If the pairing of UAV and UAVC is revoked the PDU session for C2 communication shall be released by the SMF.
During the registration procedure for UAS services direct C2 communication can be authorized as described in subclause 5.5.1.2. A UE supporting A2X over NRPC5 can perform registration procedure for UAS services including a request for authorization of direct C2 communication by providing CAAlevel UAV ID and C2 authorization payload.
#### 4.22.5	Support of no-transmit zone
The UE supporting UAS services can have notransmit zone assistance information.
The notransmit zone assistance information is a list of entries where each entry indicates one or more restricted frequency bands of a notransmit zone a geographic area where the notransmit zone is valid and zero or more time periods indicating when the notransmit zone is valid. If no time period is included in an entry the notransmit zone is valid regardless of the time. Each geographic area is indicated by a 4point polygon as specified in 3GPP TS 23.032 4B and minimum and maximum values of altitude. Each point of polygon is indicated by longitude and latitude. Each time period is indicated by minimum and maximum values of date and time in UTC.
NOTE 1 Enforcement of a notransmit zone based on the notransmit zone assistance information depends on local regulation and is UE implementation specific.
NOTE 2 Subject to local regulation the UE is not expected to transmit signalling or data when in a notransmit zone.
#### 4.23.1	General
A 5GS can support 3GPP satellite NGRAN access technology see 3GPP TS 23.501 . This subclause describes NASspecific aspects of the 5GS features to support 3GPP satellite NGRAN access technology.
#### 4.23.2	List of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location"
For 3GPP satellite NGRAN the UE shall store a list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location. Each entry consists of
a the PLMN identity of the PLMN which sent a message including 5GMM cause value #78 PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location via satellite NGRAN access technology and
b the geographical location if known by the UE where 5GMM cause value #78 was received on satellite NGRAN access technology and
c if the geographical location exists a UE implementation specific distance value.
Before storing a new entry in the list the UE shall delete any existing entry with the same PLMN identity. Upon storing a new entry the UE starts a timer instance associated with the entry with an implementation specific value that shall not be set to a value smaller than the timer value indicated by the network in the Lower bound timer value IE if any. If the Lower bound timer value IE was not provided by the network the value of the timer shall be set based on the UE implementation.
The UE is allowed to attempt to access a PLMN via satellite NGRAN access technology which is part of the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location only if
a the current UE location is known a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN and the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE implementation specific value or
b the access is for emergency services see 3GPP TS 23.122 for further details.
NOTE 1 When the UE is accessing network for emergency services it is up to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to operate.
NOTE 2 While location determination is ongoing to ensure that operator and regulatory policies are met the AMF can perform DNNbased or SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclauses 5.3.10 and 5.3.11 to prevent the UE from accessing network.
The list shall accommodate three or more entries. The maximum number of entries is an implementation decision. When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted the oldest entry shall be deleted.
Each entry shall be removed if for the entry
a the UE successfully registers via satellite NGRAN access technology to the PLMN stored in the entry except when the UE registers for emergency services or
b the timer instance associated with the entry expires.
The UE may delete the entry in the list if the current UE location is known a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN and the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE implementation specific value.
If the UE is in 5GMMDEREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE state and an entry from the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location is removed the UE shall perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
When the UE is switched off the UE shall keep the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location in its nonvolatile memory. The UE shall delete the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location if the USIM is removed.
If the UE is switched off when the timer instance associated with the entry in the list is running the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same
let t1 be the time remaining for timer instance associated with the entry in the list to timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted and considered expired. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
#### 4.23.3	5GS mobility management via a satellite NG-RAN cell
For 5GS mobility management via a satellite NGRAN cell the UE shall apply the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in table 10.2.1 for access via a satellite NGRAN cell.
NOTE 1 The applied NAS timer values are based on the current satellite NGRAN access RAT type determined based on information from lower layers.
NOTE 1A If the satellite NGRAN access RAT type is NRLEO NAS timer extensions specific to satellite NGRAN access are not applied.
The NAS timer value obtained by the UE is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be recalculated until the NAS procedure is completed restarted or aborted.
The access via a satellite NGRAN cell by a UE is indicated to the AMF by lower layers and shall be stored by the AMF. When an AMF that supports access via satellite NGRAN cells performs NAS signalling with a UE via satellite NGRAN cells the AMF shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in table 10.2.2 for access via a satellite NGRAN cell.
NOTE 2 The applied NAS timer values are based on the current satellite NGRAN access RAT type determined based on information from lower layers.
NOTE 2A If the satellite NGRAN access RAT type is NRLEO NAS timer extensions specific to satellite NGRAN access are not applied.
The NAS timer value obtained by the network is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be recalculated until the NAS procedure is completed restarted or aborted.
#### 4.23.4	5GS session management via a satellite NG-RAN cell
For 5GS session management via a satellite NGRAN cell the UE shall apply the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in table 10.3.1 for access via a satellite NGRAN cell.
NOTE 1 The applied NAS timer values are based on the current satellite NGRAN access RAT type determined based on information from lower layers.
NOTE 1A If the satellite NGRAN access RAT type is NRLEO NAS timer extensions specific to satellite NGRAN access are not applied.
The NAS timer value obtained by the UE is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be recalculated until the NAS procedure is completed restarted or aborted.
If the use of extended NAS timer for access via a satellite NGRAN cell is indicated by the AMF see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 the SMF shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in table 10.3.2 for access via a satellite NGRAN cell.
The NAS timer value obtained by the network is used as described in the appropriate procedure subclause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be recalculated until the NAS procedure is completed restarted or aborted.
#### 4.23.5	Handling multiple tracking area codes from the lower layers
When a UE camps on a satellite NGRAN cell the UE may receive multiple TACs from the lower layers. The UE shall construct TAIs from the multiple TACs i.e. concatenate the identity of the current PLMN and each of the TACs and select a TAI as follows
a if at least one TAI belongs to the current registration area of the UE the UE shall select a TAI which belongs to the current registration area of the UE according to the followings.
If there are multiple TAIs which belong to the current registration area of the UE the UE shall select a TAI as follows
1 if there is a TAI which belongs to the list of allowed tracking area if any and does not belong to the list of nonallowed tracking areas if any the UE shall select a TAI which belongs to the list of allowed tracking area if any and does not belong to the list of nonallowed tracking areas if any. In this case if there are multiple TAIs which belong to the list of allowed tracking area if any and does not belong to the list of nonallowed tracking areas if any then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and select a TAI in an implementationspecific way e.g. taking into account LADN service area information. If these multiple TAIs contain the previous current TAI the current TAI can be left unchanged.
2 if there is no TAI which belongs to the list of allowed tracking area if any and does not belong to the list of nonallowed tracking areas if any or neither the list of allowed tracking area nor the list of nonallowed tracking areas is available then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and select a TAI in an implementationspecific way e.g. taking into account LADN service area information. If these multiple TAIs contain the previous current TAI the current TAI can be left unchanged.
b if the current registration area is not available in the UE or no TAI belongs to the current registration area of the UE and
1 there is a TAI which belongs to neither the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming nor the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service the UE shall select a TAI which belongs to neither the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming nor the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service. In this case if there are multiple TAIs which belong to neither the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming nor the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and select a TAI in an implementationspecific way.
2 all TAIs belong to the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming or the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and select a TAI in an implementationspecific way.
The UE shall consider the selected TAI as the current TAI. The UE shall select a TAI when
a the UE receives multiple TACs from the lower layers or
b the UE has received multiple TACs from the lower layers upon starting to camping on the current cell and the registration area the list of allowed tracking areas the list of nonallowed tracking areas the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming or the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service is updated.
Handling of the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming and the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service is specified in subclause 5.3.13.
### 4.24	Minimization of service interruption
The UE and the network may support Minimization of service interruption MINT. MINT aims to enable a UE to obtain service from a PLMN offering disaster roaming services when a disaster condition applies to the UE determined PLMN with disaster condition.
If the UE supports MINT the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE the indication of applicability of lists of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition provided by a VPLMN the one or more list of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range provisioned by the network if available are stored in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C and are kept when the UE enters 5GMMDEREGISTERED state. Annex C specifies condition under which the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE the indication of applicability of lists of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition provided by a VPLMN the one or more lists of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range stored in the ME are deleted.
Upon selecting a PLMN for disaster roaming as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122
a if the UE does not have a stored disaster roaming wait range the UE shall perform a registration procedure for disaster roaming services on the selected PLMN as described in subclause 5.5.1 and
b if the UE has a stored disaster roaming wait range the UE shall generate a random number within the disaster roaming wait range and start a timer with the generated random number. While the timer is running the UE shall not initiate registration on the selected PLMN except if the UE needs to request an emergency PDU session in which case the UE shall initiate the registration procedure set the 5GS registration type IE to emergency registration in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and keep the timer running. Upon expiration of the timer if the UE does not have an emergency PDU session the UE shall perform a registration procedure for disaster roaming services as described in subclause 5.5.1 if still camped on the selected PLMN. If the UE has an emergency PDU session when the timer expires the registration procedure for disaster roaming services as described in subclause 5.5.1 shall be performed after the release of the emergency PDU session if the UE is still camped on the selected PLMN.
If the UE is switched off when the timer for disaster roaming wait range is running the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on the USIM in the UE remains the same and the UE selects the PLMN for disaster roaming
let t1 be the time remaining for the timer for disaster roaming wait range timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
Upon determining that a disaster condition has ended as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122
a the UE shall stop the timer started with a generated random number within the disaster roaming wait range if running
b the UE shall perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 except if the UE already selected an allowable PLMN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 and
c if the UE selects the UE determined PLMN with disaster condition and has a stored disaster return wait range which is
1 provided by the PLMN providing disaster roaming services or
2 provided by the selected PLMN
the UE shall generate a random number within the disaster return wait range start a timer with the generated random number value and enter 5GMMDEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATION state or 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE state if registered. While the timer is running the UE shall not initiate registration on the selected PLMN except if the UE needs to request an emergency PDU session in which case the UE shall initiate the registration procedure set the 5GS registration type IE to emergency registration in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and keep the timer running. Upon expiration of the timer if the UE does not have an emergency PDU session the UE shall perform a registration procedure if still camped on the selected PLMN. If the UE has an emergency PDU session when the timer expires the registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1 shall be performed after the release of the emergency PDU session if the UE is still camped on the selected PLMN.
Otherwise the UE shall perform registration procedure in the selected PLMN.
If the UE is switched off when the timer for disaster return wait range is running the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on the USIM in the UE remains the same and the UE selects the UE determined PLMN with disaster condition
let t1 be the time remaining for the timer for disaster return wait range timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
When the AMF assigns a registration area to the UE registered for disaster roaming services the AMF shall only include TAIs covering the area with the disaster condition.
When the AMF determines that the disaster condition has ended and the UE which is registered for disaster roaming services has an emergency PDU session the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure to indicate that the UE is registered for emergency services as described in subclause 5.4.4.2.
Interworking with EPS is not supported for UEs that are registered for disaster roaming services. When registering for disaster roaming services the UE indicates to the network that S1 mode is not supported as described in subclause 5.5.1.2.2. While registered for disaster roaming services and upon a need to establish an emergency PDU session or perform emergency services fallback the UE initiates the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and indicates that S1 mode is supported as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.2.
If the UE is registered for disaster roaming services and the registered PLMN is removed from forbidden PLMN lists due to reasons specified in subclause 4.4.6 or Annex C in 3GPP TS 23.122 then UE shall initiate the deregistration procedure and perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 .
### 4.25	Support of MUSIM features
A network and a MUSIM UE may support one or more of the MUSIM features i.e. the N1 NAS signalling connection release the paging indication for voice services the reject paging request the paging restriction and the paging timing collision control.
If MUSIM UE supports one or more MUSIM features the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features except for the paging timing collision control during the registration procedure. If the UE has indicated support of the N1 NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging request or both and the UE supports the paging restriction the UE indicates support of the paging restriction.
If the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features and the network decides to accept one or more MUSIM features the network indicates the support of one or more MUSIM features during the registration procedure. The network only indicates the support of the paging restriction together with the support of either N1 NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging request.
The network does not indicate support for any MUSIM feature to the UE during the registration for emergency services.
If the UE is not currently registered for emergency service and the UE receives the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the 5GS registration result IE value set to Registered for emergency services then UE shall behave as if the network did not indicate support for any MUSIM feature in the last registration procedure. If the network has sent CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the 5GS registration result IE value set to Registered for emergency services then network shall behave as if it did not indicate support for any MUSIM feature in the last registration procedure.
If a UE stops fulfilling the condition to be considered a MUSIM UE as defined in subclause 3.1 and the UE has negotiated support of one or more MUSIM features then the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate that all the MUSIM features are not supported except for the paging timing collision control as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.
A MUSIM UE operating in NBN1 mode or in WBN1 mode CE mode B does not indicate the support for paging indication for voice services during the registration procedure towards the network.
### 4.26	Support for Personal IoT Network service
The 5GS can support the personal IoT network PIN service see 3GPP TS 23.501 .
The PIN enables the personal IoT network elements PINEs to communicate with each other via PIN direct communication PIN indirect communication or PINDN communication. For the PIN indirect communication and PINDN communication a UE acting as a PIN element with gateway capability PEGC enables the PINEs behind the PEGC to connect to the network and to communicate with other PINEs within the PIN or with the DN via the PDU session established for PIN. A PEGC may serve one or more PINs. The PEGC establishes only one PDU session for each PIN. The PEGC establishes different PDU sessions for different PINs based on different DNNs and SNSSAIs. The PEGC may establish only one PDU session for multiple PINs if traffic differentiation for multiple PINs is not required in 5GS.
NOTE 1 The PIN direct communication is out of the scope of 3GPP.
The PIN PEGC and PINEs are managed by PIN element with management capability PEMC and optionally the corresponding application function. Each PIN contains at least one PEGC and at least one PEMC. The PIN architecture is captured in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
The 5GS supports the delivery of URSP rules which include the PIN ID to a PEGC registered to 5GS see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.503 . The 5GS is enhanced to support the PDU session management for PIN to ensure the endtoend QoS requirement.
The endtoend QoS requirement for each PINE over PIN indirect communication and over PINDN communication includes
a the QoS requirement in the 3GPP access network and
b the QoS requirement in the non3GPP access network.
The N3QAI is introduced to enable a PEGC to perform the QoS differentiation for the PINEs in the non3GPP access network. If the UE supports receiving the N3QAI the network may provide the N3QAI associated with the QoS flow during the PDU session establishment procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.1 or during the PDU session modification procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.2.
NOTE 2 How the PEGC applies N3QAI is outside the scope of the present document.
The non3GPP delay budget refers to the delay budget between the PEGC and the PINE in the non3GPP access network. If the UE supports providing the non3GPP delay budget the UE may provide the network with the non3GPP delay budget for the one or more QoS flows associated with the PDU sessions for a PIN during the PDU session modification procedure as defined in subclause 6.4.2. The network takes into account the received non3GPP delay budget to ensure the endtoend QoS requirement of a PINE.
NOTE 3 The support of a 5GRG or a FNRG acting as a PEGC is not specified in this release of specification.
NOTE 4 The support of redundant PDU sessions does not apply for PIN.
### 4.27	Mobile base station relay support
A 5GS can support a MBSRUE and a UE accessing to MBSR see subclause 5.35A of 3GPP TS 23.501 . This subclause describes NASspecific aspects of the 5GS features to support the authorization of the MBSRUE and the control of the UE access via MBSR.
The AMF authorizes the UEs request to act as a MBSR based on the subscription information. The AMF can indicate to the MBSRUE that it is allowed or not allowed to operate as MBSR during registration procedure as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.
Enhanced CAG information can be used for the control of UEs access via MBSR. CAG identifier is used to control the access of UE via MBSR. The 5GCN supports the UE access control based on the PLMND ID and CAG identifier broadcast by the MBSR and the CAGID authorized based on Allowed CAG list in the PLMNs entry of CAG information list stored in the UE. Time validity information can be provided to the UE together with the CAG identifier for accessing to MBSR in order to control that UE not accessing the MBSR cell outside of the time validity information. For the UE not supporting CAG functionality the 5GCN can control the access of the UE with managing the forbidden tracking area.
#### 4.28.1	General
A 5GS can support an MWABUE and a UE accessing via an MWAB see subclause 5.49 of 3GPP TS 23.501 . This subclause describes NASspecific aspects of 5GS features to support authorization of the MWABUE and control of the UE access via the MWAB.
The MWABUE is served by a BH PLMN or BH SNPN. The MWABUE establishes one or more PDU sessions for MWAB using UE local configuration and URSP rules of the MWABUE according to 3GPP TS 24.526 .
NOTE 1 The one or more PDU sessions for MWAB enable the MWAB to communicate with the core network of the MWAB broadcasted PLMN or MWAB broadcasted SNPN. Some of the one or more PDU sessions for MWAB can carry communication associated with emergency services provided to a UE served by the MWAB.
NOTE 2 The one or more PDU sessions for MWAB are associated with an SNSSAI for MWAB.
BH PLMN or BH SNPN can be the same as or different from the MWAB broadcasted PLMN or MWAB broadcasted SNPN. If the MWAB is configured to support emergency services for served UEs the BH PLMN or BH SNPN is in the same country as the MWAB broadcasted PLMN or MWAB broadcasted SNPN.
#### 4.28.2	Authorization of MWAB-UE
A UE is authorized to act as the MWABUE if the UE is allowed to establish the one or more PDU sessions for MWAB otherwise the UE is not authorized to act as the MWABUE.
NOTE 1 Whether the UE is allowed to establish the one or more PDU sessions for MWAB and thus is authorized to act as the MWABUE can be influenced e.g. by LADN service area information if DNN of a PDU session for MWAB is LADN SNSSAI time validity information SNSSAI location validity information or DNN based or SNSSAI based congestion control.
NOTE 2 If a dedicated SNSSAI for MWAB is not included in the allowed NSSAI provided in the generic UE configuration update or the registration procedure for mobility registration update then the AMF serving MWABUE can delay the notification of the SMF associated with a PDU session associated with the SNSSAI and DNN combination for MWAB to initiate the networkrequested PDU session release procedure see subclause 5.49.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 for a locally configured time.
#### 4.28.3	Control of UE access via MWAB
Editors note WIVMR\_Ph2 CR6452 Further details on control of the UE access via MWAB is FFS.
### 4.29	Support of indirect network sharing
A 5GS can support indirect network sharing between a hosting operator and participating operators as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 . The AMF may support indirect network sharing.
NOTE 1 In this version of the specification the support of indirect network sharing has no UE impact.
NOTE 2 In case of indirect network sharing the AMF of hosting operator acts towards to the UE as the AMF of the selected PLMN or the RPLMN.
NOTE 3 In order to support indirect network sharing deployment when a UE of participating operator registers in the HPLMN the HPLMN can include a PLMN ID representing the participating operator in the list of equivalent PLMNs.
NOTE 4 In case of indirect network sharing if the UE is not allowed to access the selected PLMN which represents the participating operator the AMF of hosting operator can reject the registration request using an existing cause value.
In case of indirect network sharing during the generic UE configuration update procedure see subclause 5.4.4 the registration procedure for initial registration see subclause 5.5.1.2 or the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3 if the selected PLMN ID is the PLMN ID of the HPLMN or an EHPLMN of the UE the AMF of hosting operator shall determine the available SNSSAIs of hosting operator corresponding to the SNSSAIs of participating operator provided by the UE and shall only use the corresponding SNSSAIs of participating operator towards the UE.
NOTE 5 In this case the AMF of hosting operator uses the determined SNSSAIs of hosting operator and the corresponding SNSSAIs of participating operator towards other network functions e.g. SMF.
NOTE 6 If the selected PLMN ID is different from the PLMN ID of the HPLMN or an EHPLMN of the UE the AMF of hosting operator can use SNSSAIs of hosting operator as SNSSAIs of serving PLMN and corresponding mapped HPLMN SNSSAIs.
#### 5.1.1	General
The main function of the 5GS mobility management 5GMM sublayer is to support the identification security mobility of a UE as well as generic message transport.
A further function of the 5GMM sublayer is to provide connection management services to the other sublayers.
NOTE In a satellite NGRAN access a GNSS fix time in lower layers can delay transmission of an initial UL NAS message by up to 100 seconds GNSS cold state.
#### 5.1.2	Types of 5GMM procedures
Depending on how they can be initiated three types of 5GMM procedures can be distinguished
a 5GMM common procedures
5GMM common procedure can always be initiated when the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode. The procedures belonging to this type are
1 Initiated by the network
i networkinitiated NAS transport
ii primary authentication and key agreement
iii security mode control
iv generic UE configuration update
v identification and
vi network slicespecific authentication and authorization
2 Initiated by the UE
UEinitiated NAS transport.
3 Initiated by the UE or the network and used to report certain error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol data
5GMM status.
b 5GMM specific procedures
At any time only one UE initiated 5GMM specific procedure can be running for each of the access networks that the UE is camping on. The procedures belonging to this type are
1 Initiated by the UE and used e.g. to register to the network for 5GS services and establish a 5GMM context to update the locationparameters of the UE
registration.
2 Initiated by the UE or the network and used to deregister from the network for 5GS services and to release a 5GMM context
deregistration.
3 Initiated by the UE and used to deregister from the network for 5GS services and to release a 5GMM context
eCall inactivity procedure.
c 5GMM connection management procedures
1 Initiated by the UE and used to establish a secure connection to the network or to request the resource reservation for sending data or both
service request.
The service request procedure can only be initiated if no UE initiated 5GMM specific procedure is ongoing for each of the access networks that the UE is camping on.
2 Initiated by the network and used to request the establishment of an N1 NAS signalling connection or to request reestablishment of userplane resources for the PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access or to request reestablishment of userplane resources of the PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access over 3GPP access not applicable for the non3GPP access network
paging.
3 Initiated by the network and used to request reestablishment of userplane resources of the PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access over 3GPP access or to deliver 5GSM downlink signalling messages associated with non3GPP access over 3GPP access when the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access or
Initiated by the network and used to request reestablishment of userplane resources of the PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access over 3GPP access or to deliver downlink signalling associated with 3GPP access over 3GPP access when the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access and when the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access and not in MICO mode
notification.
NOTE 1 In NBN1 mode the UE NAS using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization can wait for the lower layers to complete the transmission of the previous UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data before providing subsequent NAS messages. Other implementations are possible.
NOTE 2 When providing NAS messages to the lower layers for transmission the UE NAS using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization can prioritize sending NAS signalling messages over the UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data. How the UE performs this prioritization is implementation specific.
##### 5.1.3.1	General
In the following subclauses the 5GS mobility management 5GMM sublayer of the UE and the network is described by means of different state machines. The 5GMM sublayer states is managed per access type independently i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access. In subclause 5.1.3.2 the states of the 5GMM sublayer are introduced.

###### 5.1.3.2.2	5GS update status in the UE
In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour the 5GS update 5U status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.
If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode see 3GPP TS 23.501 the 5GS update status is stored in a nonvolatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM else in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.
If the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode the 5GS update status for each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the list of subscriber data configured in the ME see 3GPP TS 23.122 is stored in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.
The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a registration networkinitiated deregistration 5GS based primary authentication and key agreement service request paging procedure or due to change in the current TAI which does not belong to the current registration area while T3346 is running.
5U1 UPDATED
The last registration attempt was successful.
5U2 NOT UPDATED
The last registration or service request attempt failed procedurally e.g. no response or reject message was received from the AMF.
5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED
The last registration service request or registration for mobility or periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed but the answer from the AMF was negative because of roaming or subscription restrictions.

##### 5.3.1.1	Establishment of the N1 NAS signalling connection
When the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access and needs to transmit an initial NAS message the UE shall request the lower layer to establish an RRC connection. Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been established the UE shall consider that the N1 NAS signalling connection over 3GPP access is established and enter 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access.

##### 5.3.1.4	5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
This subclause is only applicable for UEs 5GMM mode over 3GPP access. The 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication is not supported when the UE is in NBN1 mode.
The UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication when the UE is in
a 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access at the NAS layer and
b RRC\_INACTIVE state at the AS layer see 3GPP TS 38.300 .
Unless stated otherwise the UE behaviour in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication follows the UE behaviour in 5GMMCONNECTED over 3GPP access except that
a the UE shall apply the mobility restrictions and
b the UE shall perform the PLMN selection procedures
as in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access.
The UE shall transition from 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access to 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been suspended.
NOTE 1 Any pending procedure or uplink data packet when receiving an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been suspended triggers a request to the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state. This is also the case when the pending procedure or uplink data packet triggered a previous request to the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state.
If the UE in 3GPP access is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 then
if the UE with the N1 NAS signalling connection established for eCall over IMS moved to 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication the UE shall start timer T3444 and
if the UE with the N1 NAS signalling connection established for a call to an HPLMN designated nonemergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service moved to 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication the UE shall start timer T3445.
Upon
a a trigger of a procedure which requires sending of a NAS message different from a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit of the 5GS update type IE set to UE radio capability update needed
b an uplink user data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended userplane resources
c a trigger to request resources for 5G ProSe direct discovery over PC5 or 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5
d a trigger to request resources for V2X communication over PC5 see 3GPP TS 23.287 6C or
e a trigger to request resources for A2X communication over PC5 see 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB
the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication over 3GPP access shall request the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state see 3GPP TS 38.300 .
For case a above if the trigger of the procedure is to request the establishment of a PDU session associated with an SNSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI the UE shall request the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state only if the current TA is in the list of TAs where the SNSSAI is allowed.
For case a above if the trigger of the procedure is to request the establishment of a PDU session associated with an SNSSAI which has SNSSAI location validity information the UE shall request the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state only if the current cell is in the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
For case b above the UE which supports SNSSAI location validity information and which has received SNSSAI location validity information from the AMF shall request the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state only if the UE is inside the NSAoS with respect to the SNSSAI which is associated with the PDU session with suspended userplane resources.
For case b above if the PDU session is associated with an SNSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI the UE shall request the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state only if the current TA is in the list of TAs where the SNSSAI is allowed.
NOTE 2 If the UE supports Small Data Transmission SDT see 3GPP TS 38.300 the following applies
a if the UE due to pending uplink NAS messages or user data packets is requesting the lower layers to transition to RRC\_CONNECTED state but has not received a response from the lower layers the UE can send the pending NAS messages or user data packets to the lower layers and can receive multiple downlink NAS messages or multiple downlink user data packets from the lower layers while the UE remains in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication over 3GPP access i.e. without transitioning to 5GMMCONNECTED mode. When the NAS layer triggers the transmission of pending uplink NAS messages or user data packets and if the SDT is ongoing the NAS layer will receive the response from the lower layers only after the SDT session has completed or failed
b the NAS layer is not aware of the classification of NAS messages or the user data packets as belonging to the SDT session at the lower layers and
c the setting of access category and the RRC establishment cause indicated to the lower layers when sending the pending uplink user data packets while the UE remains in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication is left to implementation.
Upon a trigger to send a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit of the 5GS update type IE set to UE radio capability update needed the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication shall move to 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access and proceed with the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2.
The UE shall transition from 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication to 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that the UE has transitioned to RRC\_CONNECTED state see 3GPP TS 38.300 .
NOTE 3 The AMF can be aware of the transition between 5GMMCONNECTED mode and 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication for a UE see 3GPP TS 23.502 .
The UE shall trigger a transition from 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication to 5GMMIDLE mode upon selection of a PLMN or SNPN that is not an equivalent PLMN or SNPN to the registered PLMN or SNPN.

##### 5.3.1.5	Suspend and resume of the N1 NAS signalling connection
Suspend of the N1 NAS signalling connection can be initiated by the network in 5GMMCONNECTED mode when user plane CIoT 5GS optimization is used. Resume of the suspended N1 NAS signalling connection is initiated by the UE.
In the UE when user plane CIoT 5GS optimization is used
Upon idle suspend indication from the lower layers the UE shall enter 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication shall not consider the N1 NAS signalling connection released and shall not consider the secure exchange of NAS messages terminated see subclause 4.4.2.5 and 4.4.5.
Upon trigger of a procedure using an initial NAS message when in 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication the UE shall
i if the initial NAS message is a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NGRANRCU bit of the 5GS update type IE set to UE radio capability update needed enter 5GMMIDLE mode without suspend indication and proceed with the registration procedure or
ii otherwise request the lower layer to resume the RRC connection.
NOTE 1 In NBN1 mode in the request to the lower layer the data volume information of the initial NAS message is provided to the lower layers. Interactions between the NAS and the lower layers in order to obtain the data volume information of the initial NAS message see 3GPP TS 36.321 25E 3GPP TS 36.331 25A is left to implementations.
Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been resumed when in 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication the UE shall enter 5GMMCONNECTED mode. If the pending NAS message is

#### 5.3.2	Permanent identifiers
A globally unique permanent identity the 5G subscription permanent identifier SUPI is allocated to each subscriber for 5GSbased services. The IMSI the network specific identifier the GCI and the GLI are valid SUPI types. When the SUPI contains a network specific identifier a GCI or a GLI it shall take the form of a network access identifier NAI. When the UE performs initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN or is registered for onboarding services in SNPN the SUPI contains the onboarding SUPI derived from the default UE credentials for primary authentication. The UE derives the onboarding SUPI before or during the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN and uses the derived onboarding SUPI in the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN and while registered for onboarding services in SNPN.
The structure of the SUPI and its derivatives are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 .
The UE provides the SUPI to the network in concealed form. The SUCI is a privacy preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI. When the SUPI contains a network specific identifier a GCI or a GLI the SUCI shall take the form of an NAI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 .
A UE supporting N1 mode includes a SUCI
a in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message when the UE is attempting initial registration procedure and a valid 5GGUTI is not available
b in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message if the SUCI is requested by the network during the identification procedure and
c in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message when the UE initiates a deregistration procedure and a valid 5GGUTI is not available.
If the UE uses the nullscheme as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 to generate a SUCI the SUCI contains the unconcealed SUPI.
When
not operating in SNPN access operation mode or
operating in SNPN access operation mode but not performing initial registration for onboarding services and not registered for onboarding services
the UE shall use the nullscheme if
a the home network has not provisioned the public key needed to generate a SUCI
b the home network has configured nullscheme to be used for the UE
c the UE needs to perform a registration procedure for emergency services and the USIM is still considered as valid after the failure of authentication procedure or after reception of a REGISTRATION REJECT message with the 5GMM cause #3 Illegal UE #6 Illegal ME or #7 5GS services not allowed or to initiate a deregistration procedure before the registration procedure for emergency services was completed successfully and the UE does not have a valid 5GGUTI for the selected PLMN or
d the UE receives an identity request for SUCI during a registration procedure for emergency services or during a deregistration procedure that was initiated before the registration procedure for emergency services was completed successfully.
When operating in SNPN access operation mode and
performing initial registration for onboarding services or
registered for onboarding services
the UE shall use the nullscheme if
a the public key needed to generate a SUCI is not configured as part of the default UE credentials for primary authentication or
b nullscheme usage is configured as part of the default UE credentials for primary authentication.
If
a the UE uses the nullscheme as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 to generate a SUCI
b the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and
1 an indication to use anonymous SUCI which is associated with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data is configured in the ME if the UE is not registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN or
2 an indication to use anonymous SUCI which is associated with the default UE credentials for primary authentication is configured in the ME if the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN
NOTE 1 The ME can be configured with an indication to use anonymous SUCI associated with an entry of list of subscriber data when the EAP method associated with the credentials of the entry supports SUPI privacy at the EAP layer or can be configured with an indication to use anonymous SUCI associated with the default UE credentials for primary authentication when the EAP method associated with the default UE credentials for primary authentication supports SUPI privacy at the EAP layer or both.
c the UE does not need to perform a registration procedure for emergency services or to initiate a deregistration procedure before the registration procedure for emergency services was completed successfully and
d the UE does not receive an identity request for SUCI during a registration procedure for emergency services or during a deregistration procedure that was initiated before the registration procedure for emergency services was completed successfully
then the UE shall use anonymous SUCI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 .
A WAGF acting on behalf of an FNRG shall use the nullscheme as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 to generate a SUCI.
A WAGF acting on behalf of an N5GC device shall use the nullscheme as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 to generate a SUCI.
If the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device has not obtained a SUCI from the AUN3 device the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall use the nullscheme as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 to generate a SUCI for the AUN3 device.
If a UE is a MUSIM UE the UE shall use a separate permanent equipment identifier PEI for each USIM if any and each entry of list of subscriber data if any the UE operates for accessing 5GSbased services otherwise a UE contains and uses a permanent equipment identifier PEI for accessing 5GSbased services. When the UE is registered with a network by using a USIM or an entry of list of subscriber data and has provided a PEI then until the UE is deregistered from the network using the USIM or the entry of list of subscriber data the UE shall keep using that PEI in the registration using the USIM or the entry of list of subscriber data and shall not provide that PEI in registration using another USIM or another entry of list of subscriber data.
In this release of the specification the IMEI the IMEISV the MAC address together with the MAC address usage restriction indication and the EUI64 are the only PEI formats supported by 5GS. The structure of the PEI and its formats are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 .
Each UE supporting at least one 3GPP access technology i.e. satellite NGRAN NGRAN satellite EUTRAN EUTRAN UTRAN or GERAN contains a PEI in the IMEI format and shall be able to provide an IMEI and an IMEISV upon request from the network.
Each UE not supporting any 3GPP access technologies and supporting NAS over untrusted or trusted non3GPP access shall have a PEI in the form of the Extended Unique Identifier EUI64 of the access technology the UE uses to connect to the 5GC.
A UE supporting N1 mode includes a PEI
a when neither SUPI nor valid 5GGUTI is available to use for emergency services in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration
b when the network requests the PEI by using the identification procedure in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message and
c when the network requests the IMEISV by using the security mode control procedure in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
Each 5GRG supporting only wireline access and each FNRG shall have a permanent MAC address configured by the manufacturer. For 5GCRG the permanent MAC address configured by the manufacturer shall be a cable modem MAC address.
When the 5GRG contains neither an IMEI nor an IMEISV the 5GRG shall use as a PEI the 5GRGs permanent MAC address configured by the manufacturer and the MAC address usage restriction indication set to no restrictions.
The WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG shall use as a PEI the MAC address provided by the FNRG and if the MAC address provided by the FNRG is not unique or does not correspond to the FNRGs permanent MAC address according to WAGFs configuration the MAC address usage restriction indication set to MAC address is not usable as an equipment identifier otherwise the MAC address usage restriction indication set to no restrictions.
The 5GRG when acting on behalf of an AUN3 device shall use the MAC address provided by the AUN3 device as a PEI.
The 5GRG containing neither an IMEI nor an IMEISV or the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall include the PEI containing the MAC address together with the MAC address usage restriction indication
a when neither SUPI nor valid 5GGUTI is available to use for emergency services in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration
b when the network requests the PEI by using the identification procedure in the IDENTIFICATION RESPONSE message and
c when the network requests the IMEISV by using the security mode control procedure in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
NOTE 2 In case c above the MAC address is provided even though AMF requests the IMEISV.
The WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG shall include the PEI containing the MAC address together with the MAC address usage restriction indication
a when the network requests the PEI by using the identification procedure in the IDENTIFICATION RESPONSE message and
b when the network requests the IMEISV by using the security mode control procedure in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
NOTE 3 In case b above the MAC address is provided even though AMF requests the IMEISV.
The WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall use as a PEI the MAC address provided by the N5GC device and the MAC address usage restriction indication set to no restrictions. Based on operator policy the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device may encode the MAC address of the N5GC device using the EUI64 format as specified in and use as a PEI the derived EUI64.
NOTE 4 The MAC address of an N5GC device is universallyglobally unique.
The AMF can request the PEI at any time by using the identification procedure.
If the TWIF acting on behalf of the N5CW device receives the decorated NAI for N5CW device as defined in subclause 28.7.7.1 or 28.7.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 from the N5CW device the TWIF shall first convert the decorated NAI into an NAI as specified in TS 23.502 i.e. for decorated NAI taking the form homerealm!username@otherrealm
a replace the otherrealm part with the homerealm part and
b remove homerealm!.
As a result of specified above the converted NAI takes the form username@homerealm. The TWIF shall include the converted NAI as a SUPI with SUPI format network specific identifier in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
#### 5.3.3	Temporary identities
A temporary user identity for 5GSbased services the 5G globally unique temporary identity 5GGUTI is used for identification within the signalling procedures. In case of PLMN the 5GGUTI is globally unique and in case of SNPN the 5GGUTI is unique within an SNPN. When the UE is registered to the same PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP and non3GPP access the UE and the AMF maintain one 5GGUTI that is common to both 3GPP and non3GPP access. When the UE is required to delete the 5GGUTI according to a NAS procedure the UE shall delete the 5GGUTI only if it is not registered to the same PLMN or SNPN through other access. When the UE is registered to different PLMNs or SNPNs over 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE maintains two 5GGUTIs a 5GGUTI for the registration with a PLMN or SNPN over the 3GPP access and another 5GGUTI for the registration with another PLMN or SNPN over the non3GPP access. In the paging and service request procedures a shortened form of the 5GGUTI the 5G Stemporary mobile subscriber identity 5GSTMSI is used to enable more efficient radio signalling. The purpose of the 5GGUTI and 5GSTMSI is to provide identity confidentiality i.e. to protect a user from being identified and located by an intruder. The structure of the 5GGUTI and its derivatives are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 . The 5GGUTI has two main components see 3GPP TS 23.501
a the GUAMI and
b the 5GTMSI that provides an unambiguous identity of the UE within the AMFs identified by the GUAMI.
The 5GSTMSI has three main components
a the AMF set ID that uniquely identifies the AMF set within the AMF region
b the AMF pointer that identifies one or more AMFs within the AMF set and
c the 5GTMSI.
A UE supporting N1 mode includes a valid 5GGUTI if any is available in the REGISTRATION REQUEST and DEREGISTRATION REQUEST messages. In the SERVICE REQUEST message the UE includes a valid 5GSTMSI as user identity. The AMF shall assign a new 5GGUTI for a particular UE
a during a successful initial registration procedure
b during a successful registration procedure for mobility registration update
c after a successful service request procedure invoked as a response to a paging request from the network and before the
1 release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or
2 suspension of the N1 NAS signalling connection due to user plane CIoT 5GS optimization i.e. before the UE and the AMF enter 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication
as specified in subclause 5.4.4.1 and
d after the AMF receives an indication from the lower layers that it has received the NGAP UE context resume request message as specified in 3GPP TS 38.413 for a UE in 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication and this resumption is a response to a paging request from the network and before the
1 release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or
2 suspension of the N1 NAS signalling connection due to user plane CIoT 5GS optimization i.e. before the UE and the AMF enter 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication
as specified in subclause 5.4.4.1.
The AMF should assign a new 5GGUTI for a particular UE during a successful registration procedure for periodic registration update. The AMF may assign a new 5GGUTI at any time for a particular UE by performing the generic UE configuration update procedure.
If a new 5GGUTI is assigned by the AMF the UE and the AMF handle the 5GGUTI as follows
a Upon receipt of a 5GMM message containing a new 5GGUTI the UE considers the new 5GGUTI as valid and the old 5GGUTI as invalid stops timer T3519 if running and deletes any stored SUCI. The new 5GGUTI is stored in a nonvolatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM else in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.
b The AMF considers the old 5GGUTI as invalid as soon as an acknowledgement for a registration or generic UE configuration update procedure is received.
#### 5.3.4	Registration areas
Within the 5GS the registration area is managed independently per access type i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access. The AMF assigns a registration area to the UE during the registration procedure. A registration area is defined as a set of tracking areas and each of these tracking areas consists of one or more cells that cover a geographical area. Within the 5GS the concept of registration to multiple tracking areas applies
a A tracking area is identified by a TAI which is broadcast in the cells of the tracking area. The TAI is constructed from a TAC and a PLMN identity. In case of a shared network
1 one or more TACs and
2 any of the following
i multiple PLMN identities
ii multiple SNPN identities or
iii one or more PLMN identities and one or more SNPN identities
are broadcast.
b In order to reduce the tracking area update signalling within the 5GS the AMF can assign several tracking areas to the UE. These tracking areas construct a list of tracking areas which is identified by a TAI list. When generating the TAI list the AMF shall include only TAIs that are applicable on the access where the TAI list is sent. The AMF shall be able to allocate a TAI list over different NGRAN access technologies. The AMF shall not allocate a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NBN1 mode and tracking areas not in NBN1 mode.
c The UE considers itself registered to a list of tracking areas and does not need to trigger the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update used for mobility i.e. the 5GS registration type IE set to mobility registration updating in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as long as the UE stays in one of the tracking areas of the list of tracking areas received from the AMF.
d The UE will consider the TAI list stored in the UE as valid until it receives a new TAI list in the next registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update or generic UE configuration update procedure or the UE is commanded by the network to delete the TAI list by a reject message or it is deregistered from the 5GS. If the registration request is accepted or the TAI list is reallocated by the AMF the AMF shall provide at least one entry in the TAI list. If the new and the old TAI list are identical the AMF does not need to provide the new TAI list to the UE during mobility registration update or periodic registration update.
e The TAI list can be reallocated by the AMF.
f When the UE is deregistered from the 5GS the UE shall delete the TAI list stored in the UE.
g The UE includes the last visited registered TAI if available to the AMF. The last visited registered TAI is stored in a nonvolatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM else in the nonvolatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.
##### 5.3.5.1	General
Service area restrictions are applicable only to 3GPP access and to wireline access.
Subclause 5.3.5.2 applies when the UE accesses 5GCN over 3GPP access.
Subclause 5.3.5.3 applies when the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of an FNCRG or on behalf of the N5GC device access 5GCN over wireline access.
NOTE Service area restrictions are not applicable for the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNBRG.
##### 5.3.5.2	3GPP access service area restrictions
The service area restrictions consist of tracking areas forming either an allowed area or a nonallowed area. The tracking areas belong to the registered PLMN its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or the registered SNPN. The allowed area can contain up to 16 tracking areas or include all tracking areas in the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or in the registered SNPN. The nonallowed area can contain up to 16 tracking areas. The network conveys the service area restrictions to the UE by including either an allowed area or a nonallowed area but not both in the Service area list IE of a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the network does not convey the service area restrictions to the UE in the Service area list IE of a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall treat all tracking areas in the registered PLMN its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or in the registered SNPN as allowed area and delete the stored list of allowed tracking areas or the stored list of nonallowed tracking areas.
When the UE receives a Service area list IE with an allowed area indication during a registration procedure or a generic UE configuration update procedure
a if the Type of list included in the Service area list IE does not indicate all TAIs belonging to the PLMNs in the registration area are allowed area the UE shall delete the old list of allowed tracking areas and store the tracking areas in the allowed area as the list of allowed tracking areas. If the UE has a stored list of nonallowed tracking areas the UE shall delete that list or
b if the Type of list included in the Service area list IE indicates all TAIs belonging to the PLMNs in the registration area are allowed area the UE shall treat all tracking areas in the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs or in the registered SNPN as allowed area and delete the stored list of allowed tracking areas or the stored list of nonallowed tracking areas.
When the UE receives a Service area list IE with a nonallowed area indication during a registration procedure or a generic UE configuration update procedure the UE shall delete the old list of nonallowed tracking areas and store the tracking areas in the nonallowed area as the list of nonallowed tracking areas. If the UE has a stored list of allowed tracking areas the UE shall delete that list.
If the UE is successfully registered to a PLMN or SNPN and has a stored list of allowed tracking areas
a while the current TAI is in the list of allowed tracking areas the UE shall stay in or enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE and is allowed to initiate any 5GMM and 5GSM procedures and

The list of allowed tracking areas as well as the list of nonallowed tracking areas shall be erased when
a the UE is switched off and
b the UICC containing the USIM is removed or an entry of the list of subscriber data with the SNPN identity of the SNPN is updated.

##### 5.3.5.3	Wireline access service area restrictions
If
a a SERVICE REJECT message with the 5GMM cause #28 Restricted service area
b a DL NAS TRANSPORT message with the Payload container type IE set to N1 SM information and the 5GMM cause #28 Restricted service area or
c a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes the PDU session reactivation result error cause IE with the 5GMM cause #28 Restricted service area
is received over wireline access then the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall start enforcing the wireline access service area restrictions and shall enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE.
While in the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall
a if in 5GMMIDLE mode over wireline access
1 shall not perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with Uplink data status IE except for emergency services or for high priority access and

over the wireline access.
When the 5GRG is switched off the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the 5GRG starts using another wireline access network the 5GRG shall stop enforcing the wireline access service area restrictions if enforced.
NOTE When the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device determines that the AUN3 device is switched off or the UICC containing the USIM of AUN3 device is removed the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device stops enforcing the wireline access service area restrictions if enforced.
When the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG determines that the FNCRG is switched off the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG stops enforcing the wireline access service area restrictions if enforced.
When the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device determines that the FNCRG serving the N5GC device is switched off the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device stops enforcing the wireline access service area restrictions if enforced.
#### 5.3.6	Mobile initiated connection only mode
The UE can request the use of mobile initiated connection only MICO mode during the registration procedure see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 . The UE shall not request use of MICO mode over non3GPP access. Furthermore the UE in 3GPP access shall not request the use of MICO mode during
a a registration procedure for initial registration for emergency services see subclause 5.5.1.2
b a registration procedure for initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session see subclause 5.5.1.2
c a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3 for initiating an emergency PDU session if the UE is in the state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE or
d a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3 when the UE has an emergency PDU session established.
If the UE requests the use of MICO mode the network can accept the use of MICO mode by providing a MICO indication when accepting the registration procedure. The UE may use MICO mode only if the network has provided the MICO indication IE during the last registration procedure. The UE may also request an active time value together with the MICO mode indication during the registration procedure. If the UE requests an active time by including an active time value the UE may also include the Requested T3512 value IE to request a particular T3512 value to be allocated.
If the network accepts the use of MICO mode and does not include an active time value in T3324 IE to the UE the AMF may include an all PLMN registration area allocated indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE. If the UE indicated the support for strictly periodic registration timer in the MICO indication IE to the network the network may include a strictly periodic registration timer supported indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE.
If the UE requested the use of active time by including an active time value and the network accepts the use of MICO mode and the use of active time the AMF shall include an active time value in the T3324 IE to the UE. If the AMF indicates active time value to the UE AMF should not indicate all PLMN registration area allocated indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE. Upon entering 5GMMIDLE mode AMF shall start the active timer with the active time value indicated to the UE and shall consider the UE is reachable for paging as long as the timer is running. If the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access when the active timer is running the AMF shall stop the active timer.
NOTE 1 The active time value assigned by AMF can be different from the active time value requested by the UE. AMF assigns the active time value based on several factors e.g. local configuration expected UE behaviour UE requested active time value UE subscription information network policies etc.
If the UE requested an active time and a requested T3512 value and the network accepts the use of MICO mode the AMF shall take the UE requested T3512 value into consideration when assigning a value of timer T3512 to the UE.
If the network accepts the use of MICO mode the UE may deactivate the AS layer and activate MICO mode by entering the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE if
a the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access
b the UE is in the 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE as described in subclause 5.3.5.2 state for 3GPP access and
c no T3324 value is received from the network.
If the network accepts the use of MICO mode and indicates an active time value to the UE in a successful registration procedure the UE shall start the timer T3324 with the value received from the network after entering 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access. At the expiry of the timer T3324 the UE may deactivate the AS layer and activate MICO mode by entering the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE if the UE is in the 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE as described in subclause 5.3.5.2 state for 3GPP access. If the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access when the timer T3324 is running the UE shall stop the timer T3324.
When MICO mode is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3512 T3346 T3447 T3448 T3396 T3526 T3584 T3585 T3587 any backoff timers T3245 T3247 any slice deregistration inactivity timers the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs the timer TF the timer TG the timer TS see 3GPP TS 23.122 and the timer TSENSE controlling the periodic search for PLMNs satisfying the operator controlled signal level threshold see 3GPP TS 23.122 the timer TNSU and the timer instance associated with the entry in the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location. The UE shall reset the registration attempt counter and service request attempt counter.
NOTE 2 When MICO mode is activated and if the UE is also registered over the non3GPP access the AMF will not send a NOTIFICATION message with access type indicating 3GPP access over the non3GPP access for PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access.
The UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at any time. Upon deactivating MICO mode the UE may initiate 5GMM procedures e.g. for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data.
When an emergency PDU session is successfully established after the MICO mode was enabled the UE and the AMF shall locally disable MICO mode. The UE and the AMF shall not enable MICO mode until the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode in the next registration procedure. To enable an emergency call back the UE should wait for a UE implementationspecific duration of time before requesting the use of MICO mode after the completion of the emergency services.
If the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode and does not indicate strictly periodic registration timer supported in the MICO indication IE to the UE the AMF starts the implicit deregistration timer for 3GPP access when entering 5GMMIDLE mode for 3GPP access. If AMF accepts the use of MICO mode and indicates strictly periodic registration timer supported in the MICO indication IE to the UE AMF shall start the strictly periodic monitoring timer with T3512 value indicated in the T3512 value IE after the registration procedure is completed. The AMF shall neither stop nor reset the strictly periodic monitoring timer when the NAS signalling connection is established or released for the UE. If the strictly periodic monitoring timer expires when NAS signalling connection is established for the UE AMF shall restart the strictly periodic monitoring timer with the T3512 value otherwise AMF shall start the implicit deregistration timer.
When an emergency PDU session is successfully established and the MICO mode is disabled the UE shall stop timer T3512 if running and the AMF shall stop strictly periodic monitoring timer if running. The UE and the AMF shall behave as if no strictly periodic registration timer supported indication was given to the UE in the last registration attempt.
Upon successful completion of an attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode see 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE operating in singleregistration mode shall locally disable MICO mode. After intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE operating in singleregistration mode may renegotiate MICO mode with the network during the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.
When MICO mode is activated for a UE that has joined one or more multicast MBS sessions the UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at the MBS start time and at any of the scheduled activation times of a multicast MBS session if any of those times are available as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 .
When MICO mode is activated for a UE the UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at the broadcast start time and at any of the scheduled broadcast activation times of a broadcast MBS session if any of those times are available as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 .
NOTE 3 The UE can obtain via the service announcement an MBS start time a sequence of scheduled activation times e.g. a first time and a periodicity or both of a multicast MBS session as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 or both which is out of scope of this specification. Similarly the UE can obtain via the service announcement a broadcast start time a sequence of scheduled broadcast activation times e.g. a first time and a periodicity or both of a broadcast MBS session as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 which is out of scope of this specification.
NOTE 4 Deactivating MICO mode and activating the AS layer at the MBS start time and the scheduled multicast activation times of a multicast MBS session allows the UE to listen to paging for a multicast MBS session which the has UE joined and to respond to it if received. How long the UE needs to listen to paging is up to UE implementation. Similarly deactivating MICO mode and activating the AS layer at the broadcast start time and the scheduled broadcast activation times of a broadcast MBS session allows the UE to acquire the traffic of the broadcast MBS session. If the UE fails to receive paging or data for a multicast MBS session which the UE has joined or data for a broadast MBS session the UE can as an implementation option initiate 5GMM procedures e.g. for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data to enter 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and obtain via the service announcement a new start time a sequence of scheduled activation times or both.
When MICO mode is activated the UE is allowed to join one or more multicast MBS sessions. In that case the UE can deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at the MBS start time and at any of the scheduled activation times of a multicast MBS session if any of those times are available as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 and the UE joins one or more multicast MBS sessions by using the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure or the UErequested PDU session modification procedure see subclauses 6.4.1.2 and 6.4.2.2.
NOTE 5 It is up to UE implementation whether to leave one or more multicast MBS sessions after each deactivation of each multicast MBS session and to rejoin again at the next activation time or to keep a multicast MBS session that the UE has joined for the whole period of the session as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 .
#### 5.3.7	Handling of the periodic registration update timer and mobile reachable timer
The registration procedure for periodic registration update is used over 3GPP access to periodically notify the availability of the UE to the network. The procedure is controlled in the UE by the periodic registration update timer T3512.
If the UE is registered over the 3GPP access the AMF maintains an implicit deregistration timer to control when the UE is considered implicitly deregistered over the 3GPP access. If the UE is registered over the non3GPP access the AMF also maintains a non3GPP implicit deregistration timer to control when the UE is considered implicitly deregistered over the non3GPP access. The UE registered over the non3GPP access maintains a non3GPP deregistration timer to control when the UE is considered implicitly deregistered for the non3GPP access.
The AMF shall start a non3GPP implicit deregistration timer for the UE registered over non3GPP access when the N1 NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access is released.
The UE registered over non3GPP access shall reset and start a non3GPP deregistration timer when the N1 NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access is released. The non3GPP deregistration timer is stopped when the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access or the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state over non3GPP access.
The non3GPP implicit deregistration timer shall be longer than the non3GPP deregistration timer.
The value of timer T3512 is sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE shall apply this value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE until a new value is received. The periodic registration update timer only applies to the UE registered to the 5GS services over 3GPP access.
If timer T3512 received by the UE in a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is zero then timer T3512 is deactivated and the UE shall not perform the periodic registration update procedure.
NOTE 1 The UE does not perform the registration procedure for periodic registration update for non3GPP access.
If during the registration procedure the AMF does not indicate strictly periodic registration timer supported in the MICO indication IE to the UE timer T3512 is reset and started with its initial value when the UE changes from 5GMMCONNECTED over 3GPP access or 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication over 3GPP access to 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access. Timer T3512 is stopped when the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state over 3GPP access.
If during the registration procedure the AMF indicates strictly periodic registration timer supported in the MICO indication IE to the UE timer T3512 is started with its initial value after the completion of the registration procedure. The UE shall neither stop nor reset the timer T3512 when the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED or when changing from 5GMMCONNECTED mode to 5GMMIDLE mode. If the timer T3512 expires
a the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access shall reset and start the timer T3512 with its initial value or
b the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access shall perform the periodic registration procedure.
If the UE is registered for emergency services and timer T3512 expires the UE shall not initiate a periodic registration update procedure but shall locally deregister from the network. When the UE is camping on a suitable cell it may reregister to regain normal service.
When a UE is not registered for emergency services and timer T3512 expires when the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode the registration procedure for periodic registration update shall be started.
If the UE is not registered for emergency services and is in a state other than 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE over 3GPP access when timer T3512 expires the registration procedure for periodic registration update is delayed until the UE returns to 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE over 3GPP access.
NOTE 2 When the UE returns to 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE and it needs to initiate other 5GMM procedure than the registration procedure for periodic registration update then based on UE implementation the 5GMM procedure can take precedence.
The network supervises the registration procedure for periodic registration update of the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer.
If the UE is not registered for emergency services the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than the value of timer T3512. In this case by default the mobile reachable timer is 4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3512.
The network behaviour upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer is network dependent but typically the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the first expiry and may take other appropriate actions.
If the UE is registered for emergency services the AMF shall set the mobile reachable timer with a value equal to timer T3512. When the mobile reachable timer expires the AMF shall locally deregister the UE.
The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the value as indicated above when the AMF releases the NAS signalling connection for the UE. The mobile reachable timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection is established for the UE.
Upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network shall start the implicit deregistration timer over 3GPP access. The value of the implicit deregistration timer over 3GPP access is network dependent. If MICO mode is activated the network shall start the implicit deregistration timer over 3GPP access when the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode at the AMF over 3GPP access. The default value of the implicit deregistration timer over 3GPP access is 4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3512.
If the implicit deregistration timer expires before the UE contacts the network the network shall implicitly deregister the UE. The implicit deregistration timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection is established for the UE.
If the non3GPP implicit deregistration timer expires before the UE contacts the network over the non3GPP access the network shall implicitly deregister the UE and enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED over non3GPP access for the UE. The non3GPP implicit deregistration timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access is established for the UE.
If the non3GPP deregistration timer expires before the UE contacts the network over the non3GPP access the UE shall enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED over non3GPP access. The non3GPP deregistration timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling connection over non3GPP access is established for the UE.
If the AMF provides T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to Non3GPP access in Deregistration type IE REGISTRATION REJECT message during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of timer T3512 the AMF sets the mobile reachable timer and the implicit deregistration timer such that the sum of the timer values is greater than the value of timer T3346.
If the AMF provides T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to 3GPP access in Deregistration type IE REGISTRATION REJECT message during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of the non3GPP deregistration timer the AMF sets the non3GPP implicit deregistration timer value to be 8 minutes greater than the value of timer T3346.
If the UE receives T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to 3GPP access in Deregistration type IE REGISTRATION REJECT message during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of the non3GPP deregistration timer the UE sets the non3GPP deregistration timer value to be 4 minutes greater than the value of timer T3346.
#### 5.3.8	Handling of timer T3502
The value of timer T3502 can be sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE shall apply this value in all tracking areas of the registration area assigned to the UE until a new value is received.
The value of timer T3502 can be sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message during the initial registration. If a REGISTRATION REJECT message including timer T3502 value was received integrity protected the UE shall apply this value until a new value is received with integrity protection or a new PLMN or SNPN is selected. Otherwise the default value of this timer is used.
The default value of this timer is also used by the UE in the following cases
a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received without a value specified and the 5GS registration type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is not set to periodic registration updating”
b the UE does not have a stored value for this timer
c a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs or a new SNPN has been entered the initial registration procedure fails the registration attempt counter is equal to 5 and no REGISTRATION REJECT message was received from the new PLMN or SNPN
d the network indicates that the timer is deactivated or
e a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs or a new SNPN has been entered the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update fails and the registration attempt counter is equal to 5.
#### 5.3.9	Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control
The AMF may detect 5GMM signalling congestion and perform general NAS level congestion control. Under the 5GMM signalling congestion conditions the AMF may reject 5GMM signalling requests from UEs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 . The AMF should not reject the following
a requests for emergency services
b requests for emergency services fallback
c requests from UEs configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN
d DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message
e requests for mobile terminated services triggered by paging or a notification procedure
f requests for initial registration or mobility and periodic registration update when emergency is indicated by lower layers and
g requests for mobility registration update when the UE is reporting unavailability information due to discontinuous coverage.
When general NAS level congestion control is active the AMF may include a value for the mobility management backoff timer T3346 in the reject messages. The UE starts the timer T3346 with the value received in the 5GMM reject messages. To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests the AMF should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised.
When general NAS level congestion control is active for an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN the AMF may include an appropriate cause value other than 5GMM cause #22 congestion e.g. #74 Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN in the reject messages without including timer T3346 value to allow the UE to enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH or 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform SNPN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
NOTE 0 If the AMF of an SNPN provides both localized services in SNPN and services which are not localized services in SNPN at the same location for a UE then the AMF can apply the congestion control handling for an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
If the UE is registered in the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non3GPP access and the UE receives the timer T3346 from the AMF the timer T3346 shall apply to both 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
If the UE receives the paging message or NOTIFICATION message when timer T3346 is running and the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall stop the timer T3346 for both accesses and respond to the paging message or NOTIFICATION message as specified in subclause 5.6.2 and subclause 5.6.3.
NOTE 1 As an implementation option MUSIM UE is allowed to not respond to paging based on the information available in the paging message e.g. voice service indication.
If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED the UE remains switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same then the timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same
let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
If the UE enters a new PLMN or SNPN while timer T3346 is running and the new PLMN or SNPN is not equivalent to the PLMN or SNPN where the UE started timer T3346 the UE shall stop timer T3346 when initiating 5GMM procedures in the new PLMN or SNPN.
After a change in registration area if the timer T3346 is running and 5GS update status is 5U1 UPDATED then the UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE.
If timer T3346 is running or is deactivated and
a the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN
b the UE needs to initiate signalling for emergency services or emergency services fallback or
c the UE needs to report unavailability information due to discontinuous coverage
then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GMM procedures.
NOTE 2 UE can based on implementation restrict lower layers of non3GPP access from establishing access stratum connection on a registered PLMN when timer T3346 is running for the same PLMN.
#### 5.3.10	Handling of DNN based congestion control
The AMF may detect and start performing DNN based congestion control when one or more DNN congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 are met. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a nonemergency PDU session then the AMF uses the selected DNN or the DNN associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure.
When DNN based congestion control is activated at the AMF the AMF performs the congestion control as specified in subclause 5.4.5 and the UE performs the congestion control as specified in subclause 5.4.5 and subclause 6.2.7.
#### 5.3.11	Handling of S-NSSAI based congestion control
The AMF may detect and start performing SNSSAI based congestion control when one or more SNSSAI congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 are met. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a nonemergency PDU session then the AMF uses the selected DNN or the DNN associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure. If the UE does not provide an SNSSAI for a nonemergency PDU session then the AMF uses the selected SNSSAI or the SNSSAI associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure.
The AMF may detect and start performing SNSSAI based congestion control when the UE that does not support SNSSAI location validity information requests a PDU session establishment for an SNSSAI limited by NSAoS and the UE is outside the NSAoS of the SNSSAI.
When SNSSAI based congestion control is activated at the AMF the AMF performs the congestion control as specified in subclause 5.4.5 and the UE performs the congestion control as specified in subclause 5.4.5 and subclause 6.2.8.
#### 5.3.12	Handling of local emergency numbers
The additional requirements in subclause 5.3.12A apply to a UE supporting registration or attach procedures via 3GPP access and registration procedures via non3GPP access.
In case of PLMN the network may send a local emergency numbers list or an extended local emergency numbers list or both in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message by including the Emergency number list IE and the Extended emergency number list IE respectively. The Local emergency numbers list can be updated as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 subclause 5.3.7.
In case of SNPN the network may send an extended local emergency numbers list in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message by including the Extended emergency number list IE. The network shall set the Extended Emergency Number List Validity EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE to Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received. The UE shall consider the emergency numbers received in the Extended emergency number list IE valid only in the SNPN from which this IE is received regardless of the received value of the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE.
The UE shall store the local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list as provided by the network. The local emergency numbers list stored in the UE shall be replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The extended local emergency numbers list stored in the UE shall be replaced on each receipt of the Extended emergency number list IE. The received local emergency numbers list or the received extended local emergency numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers.
The emergency numbers received in the Emergency number list IE are valid only in PLMNs in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is received. If no Emergency number list IE is contained in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message then the stored local emergency numbers list in the UE shall be kept except if the UE has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the list.
The emergency numbers received in the Extended emergency number list IE are valid only in
a PLMNs in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is received if the Extended Emergency Number List Validity EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received and
b the PLMN from which this IE is received if the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received and
c the SNPN from which this IE is received regardless of the value of the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE.
If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN has not changed then the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the UE shall be kept. If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message but the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN has changed then
a if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the UE shall be deleted and
b if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received the list shall be kept except if the UE has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the stored list.
NOTE To prevent the misrouting of emergency calls all operators within a country need to follow the regulation or agree on the setting of the Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement – either to indicate validity within a country or to indicate validity only within the PLMN.
The local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list shall be deleted at switch off or removal of the USIM. The UE shall be able to store up to ten entries in the local emergency numbers list and up to twenty entries in the Extended local emergency numbers list received from the network.
For the use of the local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list by the UE see 3GPP TS 24.301 subclause 5.3.7.
##### 5.3.12A.1	General
The requirements in subclause 5.3.12 with the clarifications and additional conditions in subclause 5.3.12A apply to a UE supporting
a attach procedures see 3GPP TS 24.301 or registration procedures via 3GPP access and
b registration procedures via non3GPP access.
The UE shall ignore the presence or absence of local emergency numbers list extended local emergency numbers list or both in a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message received via non3GPP access and keep the stored local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list if available unless conditions in subclause 5.3.12A.2 are met.
For the purposes of subclause 5.3.12A the UE is considered neither registered nor attached over 3GPP access if
1 the UE supports 3GPP access to EPC the UE does not support 3GPP access to 5GC and
a the EMM sublayer is in the EMMNULL state EMMDEREGISTERED state or EMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED state or
2 the UE supports 3GPP access to 5GC the UE does not support 3GPP access to EPC and
a the 5GMM sublayer is in the 5GMMNULL state 5GMMDEREGISTERED state or 5GMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED state or
3 supports both 3GPP access to EPC and 3GPP access to 5GC and
a the EMM sublayer is in the EMMNULL state EMMDEREGISTERED state or EMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED state and
a the 5GMM sublayer is in the 5GMMNULL state 5GMMDEREGISTERED state or 5GMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED state.
##### 5.3.12A.2	Receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message via non-3GPP access
If the UE can determine the current country and after switch on or after removal of the USIM has not been registered or has not been attached via 3GPP access in the current country then the UE shall store the local emergency numbers list or the extended local emergency numbers list or both as provided by the network with an MCC matching the current country via non3GPP access.
NOTE The UE determines as the current country the country in which it is located in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.502 .
The UE shall replace a previously stored local emergency numbers list or a previously stored extended local emergency numbers list or both with a local emergency numbers list or an extended local emergency numbers list or both received in a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message via non3GPP access if the previously stored local emergency numbers list was also received via non3GPP access or the previously stored extended local emergency numbers list was also received via non3GPP access.
The UE shall replace a previously stored extended local emergency numbers list with an extended local emergency numbers list received in a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message via non3GPP access if
a the UE is neither registered nor attached over 3GPP access
b the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received from a PLMN different from which the stored list was received and
c the stored indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received.
If no extended local emergency numbers list is contained in a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message received via non3GPP access and the UE is neither registered nor attached over 3GPP access the stored extended local emergency numbers list in the UE shall be discarded if
a the UE can determine the current country and the UE has successfully registered to a PLMN in the country and that country is different from that of the PLMN that sent the stored list or
b the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received from a PLMN different from which the stored list was received and the stored indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received.
#### 5.3.13	Lists of 5GS forbidden tracking areas
If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode the UE shall store a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming as well as a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service. Otherwise the UE shall store a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming
a per SNPN and
b if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both per entry of the list of subscriber data or if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder PLMN subscription
and store a list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service
a per SNPN and
b if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both per entry of the list of subscriber data or if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder PLMN subscription.
Within the 5GS these lists are managed independently per access type i.e. 3GPP access or wireline access. These lists shall be erased when
a the UE is switched off the UICC containing the USIM is removed an entry of the list of subscriber data with the subscribed SNPN identity identifying the current SNPN is updated or if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder the entry of the list of subscriber data associated with the lists is updated and
b periodically with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours.
Over 3GPP access when the lists are erased the UE performs cell selection according to 3GPP TS 38.304 or 3GPP TS 36.304 25C. If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode a tracking area shall be removed from the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming as well as the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service if the UE receives the tracking area in the TAI list or the Service area list of allowed tracking areas in REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
The UE operating in SNPN access operation mode shall remove a tracking area from the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming as well as the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service for
a the selected SNPN and
b when the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both for the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or when the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder the selected PLMN subscription
if the UE receives the tracking area in the TAI list or the Service area list of allowed tracking areas in REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN the access for localized services in SNPN is enabled and the validity information of
a any SNPN identified by the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN changes from not met to met or
b any GIN broadcasted by an SNPN identified by credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN changes from not met to met
the UE shall remove the tracking areas which are included in the location validity information of the SNPN in a or b if any from the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming as well as the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service for that SNPN and for the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or PLMN subscription.
The UE shall not remove the tracking area from 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming or 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service if the UE is registered for emergency services.
In N1 mode over 3GPP access the UE shall update the suitable list whenever a REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received with the 5GMM cause #12 tracking area not allowed #13 roaming not allowed in this tracking area #15 no suitable cells in tracking area or #62 no network slices available.
In N1 mode over 3GPP access if the UE receives the 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE or the 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT DEREGISTRATION REQUEST REGISTRATION ACCEPT or SERVICE ACCEPT message the UE update the suitable list with the received TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE.
If the UE receives ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message provided with SNSSAI and the PLMN ID in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE see subclause 6.5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE may remove the corresponding tracking area from the 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming.
Over wireline access the 5GRG the WAGF acting on behalf of an FNRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of an N5GC device shall update the suitable list whenever a REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received with the 5GMM cause #12 tracking area not allowed or #13 roaming not allowed in this tracking area.
NOTE In this release of the specification for untrusted non3GPP access and trusted non3GPP access neither the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming nor the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service is maintained by the UE since the UE is not able to determine the corresponding TAI.
Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs. When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted the oldest entry shall be deleted.
#### 5.3.13A	Forbidden PLMN lists
In N1 mode two lists of forbidden PLMN are managed independently per access type i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access
a the list of forbidden PLMNs as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 is applicable for 3GPP access in N1 mode. The same list is used by 5GMM for 3GPP access EMM GMM and MM see 3GPP TS 24.301 and 3GPP TS 24.008 regardless whether the UE is operating in singleregistration mode or dualregistration mode.
b the list of forbidden PLMNs for non3GPP access to 5GCN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.502 is applicable for 5GMM for non3GPP access.
The list of forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 and 3GPP TS 24.008 is applicable for 3GPP access in N1 mode. The same list is used by 5GMM for 3GPP access EMM and GMM see 3GPP TS 24.301 and 3GPP TS 24.008 regardless whether the UE is operating in singleregistration mode or dualregistration mode.
The forbidden PLMN lists shall be maintained across activation and deactivation of SNPN access operation mode.
NOTE On timer T3245 expiry when the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder using PLMN subscription and the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode as an implementation option the UE can delete the list of forbidden PLMNs forbidden PLMNs for non3GPP access to 5GCN and forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service.
#### 5.3.14	List of equivalent PLMNs
The UE shall store a list of equivalent PLMNs. These PLMNs shall be regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection and cell selectionreselection. The same list is used by 5GMM EMM GMM and MM see 3GPP TS 24.301 and 3GPP TS 24.008 except for the case when the UE operates in dualregistration mode see subclause 4.8.3.
The UE shall update or delete this list at the end of each registration procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent PLMNs as downloaded by the network plus the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list. When the UE is switched off the UE shall keep the stored list so that it can be used for PLMN selection after switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list if the USIM is removed or when the UE registered for emergency services enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED. The maximum number of possible entries in the stored list is 16.
If the UE registers to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non3GPP accesses the UE shall store an additional list of equivalent PLMNs associated with non3GPP access. The UE manages the two lists of equivalent PLMNs per access type independently.
#### 5.3.14A	List of equivalent SNPNs
The UE may support equivalent SNPNs.
If the UE supports equivalent SNPNs the ME shall store a list of equivalent SNPNs
a per entry of list of subscriber data or
b per the PLMN subscription if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder.
SNPNs in the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription shall be regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other for SNPN selection cell selection and cell reselection.
The list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription is created replaced or deleted at the end of each registration procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent SNPNs as provided by the network plus the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN that provided the list.
When the UE is switched off the UE shall keep the stored lists so that they can be used for SNPN selection after switch on.
The UE shall delete the stored list associated with an entry of list of subscriber data or the PLMN subscription when the USIM is removed the associated entry of list of subscriber data is updated or the UE registered for emergency services enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.
The maximum number of possible entries in each stored list is 16.
NOTE 1 To enable UE mobility between the registered SNPN and an equivalent SNPN the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN providing a list of equivalent SNPNs and the SNPN identityies in the list of equivalent SNPNs are assumed to be globallyunique SNPN identities.
NOTE 2 The MS can provide the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription to the lower layers.
If the UE supports equivalent SNPNs and registers to different SNPNs over 3GPP and non3GPP accesses the UE shall store an additional list of equivalent SNPNs associated with non3GPP access. The UE manages the two lists of equivalent SNPNs per access type independently.
#### 5.3.15	Transmission failure abnormal case in the UE
The abnormal case 5GMM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers can be identified for 5GMM procedures
When it is specified in the relevant procedure that it is up to the UE implementation to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered that procedure the procedure can typically be reinitiated using a retransmission mechanism of the uplink message i.e. the one that has previously failed to be transmitted with new sequence number and message authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.
NOTE The transmission failure can happen due to TAI change. The lower layer might take some time to read the system information and determine if the current TAI is changed. Therefore the information of TAI change can be sent to the NAS layer a little after receiving the transmission failure indication from the lower layer. How to handle the retransmission procedure caused by the possible delayed TAI change information is up to UE implementation.
#### 5.3.16	Extended DRX cycle for UEs in 5GMM-IDLE and 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
Extended DRX eDRX cycle is supported for a UE in N1 mode. When eDRX is requested by the UE and accepted by the network
a if the UE is not in NBN1 mode eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode or in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication or
b if the UE is in NBN1 mode eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode.
The UE may request the use of eDRX cycle during a registration procedure by including the Requested extended DRX parameters IE see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 . The UE shall not request the use of eDRX during a registration procedure for emergency services. The UE may use the extended idle mode DRX cycle length stored in the USIM see 3GPP TS 31.102 when requesting the use of eDRX.
The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a registration procedure when the UE has an emergency PDU session.
The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the registration procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure and the UE does not have an emergency PDU session.
NOTE 1 If the UE wants to keep using eDRX the UE includes the Extended DRX parameters IE in each registration procedure.
If the UE received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure upon successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session the UE shall resume eDRX.
If the network has provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure upon successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session the network shall resume eDRX.
If the UE or the network locally releases an emergency PDU session the UE or the network shall not use eDRX until the UE receives eDRX parameters during a registration procedure with PDU session context synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request procedure with PDU session context synchronization.
If the UE did not receive the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE or if the UE has an emergency PDU session the UE shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter if available.
If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX or if the UE has an emergency PDU session the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter if available.
If the network provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE and also assigned a new 5GGUTI for the UE as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.4 during the last registration procedure the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter if available with the old 5GGUTI and use the eDRX provided by the network with the new 5GGUTI until the old 5GGUTI can be considered as invalid by the network see subclauses 5.4.4.4 and 5.5.1.3.4.
NOTE 2 If the UE using eDRX has joined one or more multicast MBS sessions or wants to receive the traffic of broadcast MBS sessions the upper layers of the UE provide the lower layers with the MBS start time and the scheduled activation times of the respective MBS session if any of those times are obtained via the service announcement as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 . This interaction between the upper layers and the lower layers is out of scope of the present document. If the UE fails to receive paging or data for a multicast MBS session which the UE has joined or data for a broadast MBS session the UE can as an implementation option initiate 5GMM procedures e.g. for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data to enter 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and obtain via the service announcement a new start time a sequence of scheduled activation times or both.
#### 5.3.17	Service Gap Control
Service gap control SGC only applies to 3GPP access.
The network may control the frequency with which UEs can transition from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode via the SGC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 . If the network supports SGC and the service gap time value i.e. T3447 value is available in the 5GMM context of the UE the AMF shall consider SGC as active for the UE.
The UE and the network negotiate usage of SGC during the registration procedure for initial registration and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
a the UE supporting SGC indicates its support in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE supports SGC and the SGC is active for the UE the AMF includes T3447 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message see subclause 5.5.1.2 and subclause 5.5.1.3. The UE stores the T3447 value and
b for UEs that do not support SGC when the network rejects mobility management signalling requests because SGC is active in the network the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in subclause 5.3.9 applies.
The network can provide a new T3447 value to the UE to be used next time it is started or stop timer T3447 in the UE if running with the Generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.4.
The UE shall start timer T3447 when the N1 NAS signalling connection is released and if
a the UE supports SGC and the T3447 value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero and
b the N1 NAS signalling connection released was not established for
1 paging
2 registration procedure for initial registration with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending
3 registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending and without Uplink data status IE included
4 requests for emergency services or
5 requests for exception data reporting.
If the SGC is active in the network after the UE transitions from 5GMMCONNECTED mode to 5GMMIDLE mode except when the UE was in 5GMMCONNECTED mode due to
a paging
b registration procedure for initial registration with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending
c registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending and without Uplink data status IE included
d requests for emergency services or
e requests for exception data reporting
the network shall start timer T3447 if not already running
with the T3447 value available in the 5GMM context minus 4 minutes if the UE supports SGC and the T3447 value has been sent to the UE with a nonzero value or
with the T3447 value available in the 5GMM context if the UE does not support SGC.
When timer T3447 is running the network allows
a requests for emergency service
b requests for emergency services fallback
c requests for high priority access
d requests for exception data reporting
e registration procedure for initial registration with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending
f registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update without Uplink data status IE included and with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending or
g service request procedure or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update triggered by paging and subsequent MO signalling or MO data if any until the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode.
The UE or the network with a running T3447 timer keeps the timer running when the UE transits from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode.
NOTE If the UE transitions from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode due to registration procedure for initial registration with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending or mobility and periodic registration update request without Uplink data status IE and with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending the UE initiates no further MO signalling except for mobility and periodic registration update requests without Uplink data status and with Followon request indicator set to No followon request pending until the UE receives mobile terminated signalling e.g. DL NAS TRANSPORT message for MT SMS or MT data over user plane or after the UE has moved to 5GMMIDLE state and the service gap timer is not running.
If timer T3447 is running when the UE changes PLMN or enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED the UE remains switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires.
If the AMF determines that the UE operating in singleregistration mode has performed an intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode and the timer T3447 is running in the AMF the AMF stops the T3447.
Upon intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode if the UE supports service gap control T3447 is running in the UE and the T3447 value IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message received from the AMF see subclause 5.5.1.2 and subclause 5.5.1.3 the UE shall keep T3447 running. Additionally the UE shall store and replace the currently stored service gap time value with the received T3447 value. Upon expiry of the running T3447 timer the UE shall use the new value when starting T3447 again.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same
let t1 be the time remaining for timer T3447 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
#### 5.3.18	Restriction on use of enhanced coverage
In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network the operator may prevent specific subscribers from using enhanced coverage see 3GPP TS 23.501 . When in NBN1 mode the UE shall indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. When in WBN1 mode the UE supporting either CE mode A or CE mode B shall indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. The UE supporting restriction on use of enhanced coverage indicates its support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage the AMF indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message see subclause 5.5.1.2 and subclause 5.5.1.3 that
a when in WBN1 mode whether CE mode B is restricted for the UE or both CE mode A and CE mode B are restricted for the UE or both CE mode A and CE mode B are not restricted for the UE or
b when in NBN1 mode whether the use of enhanced coverage is restricted or not for the UE.
If
a the use of enhanced coverage is restricted
b the use of CE mode B is restricted or
c the use of CE mode A and CE mode B is restricted
the UE shall not use enhanced coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.
If the UE supports CE mode B and the network determines that
a the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE or
b CE mode B is not restricted for the UE
the applicable NAS timer values shall be calculated by the network as described in subclause 4.19 and subclause 4.20.
For a UE that supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage or CE mode B if
a the AMF determines to enforce a change in restriction on the use of enhanced coverage or a change in the restriction on the use of CE mode B as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 and
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode and there is no ongoing registration procedure
the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure to indicate registration requested and release of the N1 NAS signalling connection not requested as described in subclause 5.4.4. After the successful completion of the registration procedure for mobility registration update including change of the restriction on the use of enhanced coverage for any SMF with which the UE has an established PDU session the AMF updates the SMF with the indication on the use of extended NAS timer setting as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 .
#### 5.3.19	Handling of congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane
The network may activate congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
If the UE has indicated support for the control plane CIoT 5GS optimizations and the network decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane the network may include a value for the control plane data backoff timer T3448 in REGISTRATION ACCEPT SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message and shall store a control plane data backoff time on a per UE basis. The UE starts the timer T3448 with the value informed in the message. To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests the network should select the value for the timer T3448 for the informed UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised. Based on local policy the network need not include a value for the control plane data backoff timer T3448 in REGISTRATION ACCEPT SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message to a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN.
The network sends REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or SERVICE ACCEPT message without T3448 value IE to stop the timer T3448 running in the UE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.4 and subclause 5.6.1.4.
Based on the stored control plane data backoff time for the UE the network may reject the transfer of user data via the control plane initiated by the UE. Based on local policy the network shall not reject the transfer of user data via the control plane initiated by a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN.
While the timer T3448 is running the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode does not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure except if the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the user data is related to an exceptional event.
The UE is allowed
a to respond to paging with CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message without uplink data or
b to send a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message for emergency services or for emergency services fallback
even if the timer T3448 is running.
Upon entering the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED or a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started the timer T3448 or upon being switched off while the timer T3448 is running the UE stops the timer T3448.
##### 5.3.19A.1	UE not operating in SNPN access operation mode
The following requirements apply for a UE that is configured to use timer T3245 see 3GPP TS 24.368 or 3GPP TS 31.102 .
When the UE adds a PLMN identity to the forbidden PLMN list or sets the USIM as invalid for 5GS services for 3GPP access or non3GPP access and timer T3245 see 3GPP TS 24.008 is not running the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 subclause 4.1.1.6.
Upon expiry of the timer T3245 the UE shall erase the forbidden PLMN list and forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list and set the USIM to valid for 5GS services for 3GPP access and non3GPP access.

let t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the UE will follow the behaviour as defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.

When the UE adds an SNPN to the permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list or temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list which are associated with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription for 3GPP access or non3GPP access and timer T3245 is not running
a if there is no next valid time period for the SNPN the UE shall start timer T3245 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 12h and 24h or
b if there is next valid time period for the SNPN the UE shall start timer T3245 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between the start time point and the end time point of the next valid time period for localized services in SNPN.
NOTE 1 The random value to calculate the value of timer T3245 can be UE implementationspecific value for the UE to perform SNPN selection for localized services in SNPN and receive localized services in the SNPN before the valid time of localized services ends.
Upon expiry of the timer T3245 the UE shall erase the permanently forbidden SNPNs lists and temporarily forbidden SNPNs lists and set the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription to valid for 3GPP access and non3GPP access. When the lists are erased the UE performs cell selection according to 3GPP TS 38.304 .

#### 5.3.21	CIoT 5GS optimizations
CIoT 5GS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS transfer. A UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can indicate the 5GS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during the registration procedure see 3GPP TS 23.502 . The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization user plane CIoT 5GS optimization N3 data transfer and header compression see subclause 9.11.3.1. Furthermore the UE may separately from the indication of support indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization see subclause 9.11.3.9A. The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use. A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can also indicate the EPS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support during the registration procedure. Furthermore the UE may separately from the indication of support indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization.
NOTE 1 CIoT 5GS optimizations are not supported by NR connected to 5GCN.
NOTE 2 If the UE does not support user plane CIoT 5GS optimization it does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization.
The UE can be in NBN1 mode or WBN1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT 5GS optimizations during the registration procedure. A UE in NBN1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization.
In NBN1 mode the UE when requesting the use of CIoT 5GS optimizations does not
a request an initial registration for emergency services
b request a PDU session establishment for emergency PDU session or
c indicate UEs usage setting during the registration procedure.
The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency services when the UE is in NBN1 mode see subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4.
The control plane CIoT 5GS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data IP Ethernet and Unstructured or SMS messages over control plane via the AMF without triggering userplane resources establishment. The support of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is mandatory for the network in NBN1 mode and optional in WBN1 mode. Optional header compression of IP data and Ethernet data can be applied to PDU sessions with IP PDU session type and Ethernet PDU session type that are configured to support header compression. For IP header compression Robust Header Compression ROHC protocol specified in IETF RFC 5795 39B is used. For Ethernet header compression Ethernet Header Compression EHC protocol specified in 3GPP TS 38.323 is used.
For a UE that supports Location Services LCS notification mechanisms in N1 mode the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization also enables the transport of location services messages from 5GMMIDLE mode using the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message when location services are requested see subclause 6.7.1 in 3GPP TS 23.273 6B.
The user plane CIoT 5GS optimization enables support for change from 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access to 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access without the need for using the service request procedure see subclause 5.3.1.5.
If the UE supports user plane CIoT 5GS optimization it shall also support N3 data transfer.
If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT 5GS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT 5GS optimizations and decides to accept the registration request the network indicates the supported CIoT 5GS optimizations to the UE per registration area when accepting the UE request. Network indication of support is interpreted by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature. After completion of the registration procedure the UE and the network can then use the accepted CIoT 5GS optimizations for the transfer of user data IP Ethernet Unstructured and SMS.
A UE in NBN1 mode or WBN1 mode can request the use of SMS over NAS by setting the SMS requested bit of the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2.
The AMF indicates whether it allows the use of SMS over NAS for a UE in NBN1 mode or WBN1 mode by setting the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4.
If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization and N3 data transfer then when receiving the UEs request for a PDU session establishment the AMF decides whether the PDU session should be NEF PDU session or N6 PDU session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and then
a if NEF PDU session is to be established for unstructured data type the AMF includes control plane only indication for the requested PDU session to the SMF
b if N6 PDU session is to be established and the DNN or SNSSAI of the newly requested N6 PDU session supports interworking with EPS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502
1 if there are existing N6 PDU sessions supporting interworking with EPS for this UE that were established with the control plane only indication the AMF includes the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF or
2 if there are existing N6 PDU sessions supporting interworking with EPS for this UE that were established without the control plane only indication the AMF does not include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF
3 if there is no existing N6 PDU session supporting interworking with EPS for this UE the AMF determines whether to include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF based on local policies the UEs preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour and
c if N6 PDU session is to be established and the DNN or SNSSAI of the N6 PDU session does not support interworking with EPS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 the AMF determines whether to include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF based on local policies the UEs preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour.
In NBN1 mode if the UE or the network does not support N3 data transfer then when receiving the UEs request for a PDU session establishment the AMF decides whether the PDU session should be NEF PDU session or N6 PDU session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and then includes the control plane only indication for the requested PDU session to the SMF.
If the network supports user plane CIoT 5GS optimization it shall also support N3 data transfer.
Broadcast system information may provide information about support of CIoT 5GS optimizations see 3GPP TS 36.331 25A. At reception of new broadcast system information the lower layers deliver it to the 5GMM layer in the UE. The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether certain CIoT 5GS optimizations are supported in the cell.
The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT 5GS optimizations which are indicated as not supported.
In NBN1 mode at any given time there cannot be userplane resources established for a number of PDU sessions that exceeds the UE s maximum number of supported userplane resources. The UE in NBN1 mode shall not
a request the establishment of userplane resources for a number of PDU sessions that exceeds the UE s maximum number of supported userplane resources or
b initiate the establishment of a new PDU session or request the transfer of a PDU session from the non3GPP access to the 3GPP access if
1 the UE has indicated preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization
2 the network accepted the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization and
3 the UE currently has userplane resources established fora number of PDU sessions that is equal to the UE s maximum number of supported userplane resources.
The AMF enforces a limit on the number of PDU sessions with active userplane resources for a UE in NBN1 mode based on the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources as follows
a there can be a maximum of one PDU session with active userplane resources when the Multiple userplane resources support bit is set to Multiple userplane resources not supported or
b there can be a maximum of two PDU sessions with active userplane resources when the Multiple userplane resources support bit is set to Multiple userplane resources supported.
A PDU session for a UE in NBN1 mode shall only have one QoS rule and that is the default QoS rule. Reflective QoS is not supported in NBN1 mode. Reflective QoS is not applicable for a PDU session with control plane only indication.
In NBN1 mode when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT 5GS optimizations to the lower layers. If the UE requests the use of N3 data transfer without user plane CIoT 5GS optimization then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization to lower layers.
In WBN1 mode when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT 5GS optimizations to the lower layers.
#### 5.3.22	Interaction between MICO mode with active time and extended idle mode DRX cycle
The UE can request the use of both MICO mode with active time and eDRX during a registration procedure but it is up to the network to decide to enable none one of them or both see 3GPP TS 23.501 .
If the network accepts the use of both MICO mode with active time see subclause 5.3.6 and eDRX see subclause 5.3.16 the extended DRX parameters provided to the UE should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer expires.
#### 5.3.23	Forbidden wireline access area
The AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message over a wireline access network with the 5GMM cause #77 wireline access area not allowed if conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D for AMFs enforcement of forbidden area are fulfilled.
If a REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received over a wireline access network with the 5GMM cause #77 wireline access area not allowed
a the 5GRG shall not access 5GCN over the wireline access network until the 5GRG is switched off the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the 5GRG starts using another wireline access network
NOTE When the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device receives a REGISTRATION REJECT SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message over a wireline access network with the 5GMM cause #77 wireline access area not allowed the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device can prevent reattempt of the same procedure until the AUN3 device is switched off or the UICC containing the USIM of the AUN3 device is removed.
b the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG shall not access 5GCN until the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG determines that the FNCRG is switched off and
c the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall not access 5GCN until the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNCRG determines that the FNCRG serving the N5GC device is switched off.
#### 5.3.24	WUS assistance
A UE supporting reception of WUS assistance information indicates its capability for reception of WUS assistance information during registration procedure see 3GPP TS 23.501 . The UE supporting WUS assistance information may include its UE paging probability information in the Requested WUS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message see 3GPP TS 23.501 . The UE shall not include its UE paging probability information during
a a registration procedure for initial registration for emergency services see subclause 5.5.1.2
b a registration procedure for initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session see subclause 5.5.1.2
c a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3 for initiating an emergency PDU session if the UE is in the state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE or
d a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3 when the UE has an emergency PDU session established.
The UE and the network may negotiate the UE paging probability information during a registration procedure when the UE does not have an emergency PDU session. The UE paging probability information is an assistance information used to determine the WUS group for paging UE see 3GPP TS 23.501 3GPP TS 36.300 25B.
NOTE 1 The determination of UE paging probability information is up to UE implementation.
If a UE supporting WUS assistance information did not receive the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure due to an active emergency PDU session over 3GPP access the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update to request WUS assistance information after the emergency PDU session is released over 3GPP access.
If the UE does not have an emergency PDU session and the network accepts the use of the WUS assistance information for the UE the network determines the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE based on the requested UE paging probability information if any local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE and then indicates the negotiated UE paging probability information in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The network shall store the negotiated UE paging probability information in the 5GMM context of the UE for paging.
The UE shall use WUS assistance information only if the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure. If the UE did not receive the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure the UE shall delete any existing WUS assistance information received from the network.
If the network did not accept the request to use WUS assistance information the network shall delete the stored negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE if available.
When an emergency PDU session is successfully established after the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure the UE and the AMF shall not use WUS assistance information until
the successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session
the UE receives WUS assistance information during a registration procedure with PDU session status IE or upon successful completion of a service request procedure if the UE or the network locally releases the emergency PDU session or
the successful completion of the handover of the emergency PDU session to non3GPP access.
NOTE 2 WUS assistance is not supported by NR connected to 5GCN.
#### 5.3.25	Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping Assistance
A UE may indicate its capability to support NR paging subgrouping during registration procedure when the UE
initiates a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE not set to emergency registration and
does not have an active emergency PDU session.
NOTE The requirements for UEID based PEI are specified in 3GPP TS 38.300 .
If a UE supporting NR paging subgrouping did not indicate its capability to support NR paging subgrouping during the last registration procedure due to an active emergency PDU session over 3GPP access the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate its capability to support NR paging subgrouping after the emergency PDU session is released over 3GPP access.
If the UE indicates support of NR paging subgrouping the UE may include its paging probability information in the Requested PEIPS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE indicates support of NR paging subgrouping and the network supports and accepts the use of the PEIPS assistance information for the UE the network provides to the UE the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information including the Paging subgroup ID in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. The Paging subgroup ID is used to determine the NR paging subgroup for paging the UE. The UE NAS layer shall indicate the Paging subgroup ID to the access stratum layer. The network shall store the Paging subgroup ID in the 5GMM context of the UE.
The UE shall use PEIPS assistance information only if the UE received the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure. If the UE did not receive the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure the UE shall delete any existing PEIPS assistance information received from the network.
If the network did not accept the request to use PEIPS assistance information during the registration procedure the network shall delete the stored PEIPS assistance information for the UE if available.
If the UE supports the use of the PEIPS assistance information and the network supports and accepts the use of the PEIPS assistance information the network may provide the PEIPS assistance information to the UE by including the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
When an emergency PDU session is successfully established over 3GPP access after the UE received the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure the UE and the AMF shall not use PEIPS assistance information until
the successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU
the UE receives PEIPS assistance information during a registration procedure with PDU session status IE or upon successful completion of a service request procedure if the UE or the network locally releases the emergency PDU session
the successful completion of handover of emergency PDU session to non3GPP access or
the successful transfer of the emergency PDU session in 5GS to the EPS or ePDG connected to EPC.
#### 5.3.26	Support for unavailability period
If the UE and network support unavailability period and an event is triggered in the UE making the UE unavailable for a certain period of time and the unavailability is not due to discontinuous coverage the UE may store its 5GMM and 5GSM context in USIM or nonvolatile memory in the ME to be able to reuse it after the unavailability period.
NOTE 1 How and where the UE stores its contexts depends upon the UE implementation. The UE can store some or all of its contexts in the ME or USIM using existing ME or USIM functionality.
To activate the unavailability period either the UE provides unavailability information including a type of unavailability an unavailability period duration if known and the start of the unavailability period if known during the registration procedure or the UE provides unavailability information including the type of unavailability and the unavailability period duration if known during the deregistration procedure see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 . The support for the unavailability period is negotiated in the registration procedure. If the UE is registered to a PLMN via a satellite NGRAN cell the AMF may for discontinuous coverage provide the unavailability period duration of the UE the start of the unavailability period or both to the UE during the registration procedure. The AMF may consider the unavailability period duration provided by the UE if available and determine the unavailability period duration of the UE as described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4. The AMF may also consider the start of the unavailability period provided by the UE if available and determine the start of the unavailability period of the UE as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.4.
If the UE provided unavailability information in the last registration procedure for mobility registration or the deregistration procedure the AMF considers the UE unreachable until the UE registers for a normal service. If the UE did not include a start of the unavailability period the AMF shall consider the start of the unavailability period to be the time at which AMF received the REGISTRATION REQUEST message or the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message from the UE. During the registration procedure the AMF may determine the values of the negotiated extended DRX parameters the timer T3324 and the periodic registration update timer T3512 to be provided to the UE based on the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset the unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period based on their availability. The AMF should set the value of the mobile reachable timer and implicit deregistration timer based on the unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period. The AMF releases the N1 signalling connection after the completion of the registration procedure in which the UE provided unavailability information without providing the start of the unavailability period.
NOTE 2 If the UE supports MUSIM and the UE is registered with the support of unavailability period then the UE can indicate a different unavailability periods to each registered network.
NOTE 3 The AMF sets the value of the mobile reachable timer longer than the unavailability period duration.
If for discontinuous coverage the UE has stored a discontinuous coverage maximum time offset as described in subclause 5.4.4.3 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4 the UE shall set the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value to a random value up to the stored discontinuous coverage maximum time offset for this PLMN and satellite NGRAN RAT Type determine a time point equal to the time when the UE is about to lose satellite coverage minus the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value and send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message for mobility and periodic registration update to the AMF indicating out of satellite coverage at the determined time point.
If for discontinuous coverage the UE has stored a discontinuous coverage maximum time offset as described in subclause 5.4.4.3 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4 upon returning in satellite coverage of a TA in the current registration area after being out of satellite coverage due to discontinuous coverage the UE starts the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer to a random value up to the stored discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value if available for this PLMN and NR satellite access and starts the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer. The UE shall enter 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE state and shall not initiate any NAS signalling on that NR satellite access and PLMN while the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer is running. The UE shall stop the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer and initiate NAS signalling if the UE
a receives paging message receives a NOTIFICATION message over non3GPP access as described in case b subclause 5.6.3.1
b has pending emergency services
c is establishing an emergency PDU session
d is performing emergency services fallback procedure
e enters a TAI outside the registration area
f is a MUSIM UE and needs to request a new 5GGUTI assignment as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2
g is allowed to use exception data reporting see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 and the UE has to transmit user data related to an exceptional event or
h is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN.
At expiry of the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer if the EUPR bit of the Unavailability configuration IE in the last REGISTRATION ACCEPT message was set to UE needs to report end of unavailability period the UE shall perform a registration procedure for mobility registration update.
If the AMF sets the EUPR bit value in the Unavailability configuration IE to UE does not need to report end of unavailability period then upon returning to a TA in the current registration area the UE shall choose an appropriate substate of 5GMMREGISTERED and the UE is not required to trigger the registration procedure for mobility registration update when the unavailability period duration has ended. If the AMF does not provide the Unavailability configuration IE or the AMF sets the EUPR bit value in the Unavailability configuration IE to UE needs to report end of unavailability period when the unavailability period duration has ended and the UE returns in satellite coverage of a TA in the current registration area after being out of satellite coverage due to discontinuous coverage the UE shall trigger registration procedure for mobility registration update and the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer has expired if any.
When the unavailability period is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3512 T3324 T3346 T3444 T3445 T3447 T3448 T3396 T3526 T3584 T3585 T3587 any backoff timers T3245 T3247 the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs the timer TSENSE controlling the periodic search for PLMNs satisfying the operator controlled signal level threshold the timer TF the timer TG the timer TS see 3GPP TS 23.122 the timer TNSU and the timer instance associated with the entry in the list of PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location slice deregistration inactivity timer when the UE activates the unavailability period using registration procedure the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter and service request attempt counter.
When the UE activates the unavailability period using registration procedure without providing the start of the unavailability period then after successful completion of the procedure the UE shall enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE and may deactivate AS layer. Otherwise if the UE provided the start of unavailability period in the registration procedure the UE shall enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE and may deactivate AS layer only after the UE activates the unavailability period.
When the UE activates the unavailability period using the deregistration procedure then after successful completion of the procedure the UE shall enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.NOCELLAVAILABLE and deactivate the AS layer.
When the UE comes out of the unavailability period the UE shall activate the AS layer if deactivated and perform registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2.
##### 5.4.1.1	General
The purpose of the primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to enable mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to provide keying material that can be used between the UE and network in subsequent security procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Two methods are defined
a EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
b 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The UE and the AMF shall support the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
###### 5.4.1.2.1	General
The purpose of the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to agree on the keys KAUSF KSEAF and KAMF see 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Extensible authentication protocol EAP as specified in IETF RFC 3748 enables authentication using various EAP methods.
EAP defines four types of EAP messages
a an EAPrequest message
b an EAPresponse message
c an EAPsuccess message and
d an EAPfailure message.
Several rounds of exchanges of an EAPrequest message and a related EAPresponse message can be required to achieve the authentication see example in figure 5.4.1.2.1.1.
The EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network.
The EAPrequest message the ngKSI and the ABBA are transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message of the EAP message reliable transport procedure.
The EAPresponse message is transported from the UE to the network using the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message of the EAP message reliable transport procedure.
If the authentication of the UE completes successfully the serving AMF intends to initiate a security mode control procedure after the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the security mode control procedure intends to bring into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the EAPsuccess message and the ngKSI are transported from the network to the UE using the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message of the security mode control procedure see subclause 5.4.2.
If the authentication of the UE completes successfully and the serving AMF does not intend to initiate a security mode control procedure bringing into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the EAPsuccess message and the ngKSI are transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure.
NOTE 1 The serving AMF will not initiate a security mode control procedure after the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure e.g. in case of AMF relocation during registration procedure.
If the authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully the EAPfailure message is transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure or in a response of the initial 5GMM procedure as part of which the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is performed.
The AMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETF RFC 3748 subclause 4.3 to infinite value.
NOTE 2 The EAP message reliable transport procedure provides a reliable transport of EAP messages and therefore retransmissions at the EAP layer do not occur.
The AUSF and the AMF support exchange of EAP messages using N12.
The UE shall detect and handle any duplication of EAP message as specified in IETF RFC 3748 .

###### 5.4.1.2.2	EAP-AKA' related procedures
5.4.1.2.2.1 General
The UE shall support acting as EAPAKA peer as specified in IETF RFC 5448 . The AUSF may support acting as EAPAKA server as specified in IETF RFC 5448 . The AAA server of the Credentials Holder CH or the Default Credentials Server DCS may support acting as EAPAKA server as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
The EAPAKA enables mutual authentication of the UE and the network.
The UE can reject the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message sent by the network. The UE shall proceed with an EAPrequestAKAchallenge message only if a USIM is present.
During a successful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the CK and IK are computed by the USIM. CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to generate an EMSK or MSK.
5.4.1.2.2.2 Initiation
In order to initiate the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAPAKA the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall send an EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 . The AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall set the AT\_KDF\_INPUT attribute of the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message to the SNN. The SNN is in format described in subclause 9.12.1. The AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS may include AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute in the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message.
The network shall select an ngKSI value. If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM procedure the network shall select a different ngKSI value. The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the UE along with each EAP message. The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause 9.11.3.10 to the UE along with the EAP request message and EAPsuccess message.
Upon receiving an EAPrequestAKAchallenge message the UE shall check whether the UE has a USIM shall check the key derivation function indicated in AT\_KDF attributes as specified in IETF RFC 5448 and if the value of the Key derivation function field within the received AT\_KDF attribute is of value 1 shall check
a whether the network name field of the AT\_KDF\_INPUT attribute is the SNN constructed according to subclause 9.12.1 and
b whether the network name field of the AT\_KDF\_INPUT attribute matches the PLMN identity or the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN saved in the UE.
When not operating in SNPN access operation mode the PLMN identity the UE uses for the above network name check is as follows
a when the UE moves from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode until the first handover the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN and
b after handover or intersystem change to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode
1 if the target cell is not a shared network cell the UE shall use the PLMN identity received as part of the broadcast system information
2 if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5GGUTI and
3 if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 4GGUTI but not a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 4GGUTI.
When operating in SNPN access operation mode the SNPN identity the UE uses for the above network name check is the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN.
5.4.1.2.2.3 UE successfully authenticates network
If a USIM is present and the SNN check is successful the UE shall handle the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 . The USIM shall derive CK and IK and compute the authentication response RES using the 5G authentication challenge data received from the ME and pass RES to the ME. The ME shall derive CK and IK from CK and IK and if the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and the credentials in the USIM contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then derive MSK from CK and IK otherwise derive EMSK from CK and IK.
NOTE 1 When the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN credentials in the USIM do not contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
Furthermore if the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and the credentials in the USIM
contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the MSK otherwise the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the EMSK.
If the ME generates a new KAUSF the ME shall generate a new KSEAF from the new KAUSF and the KAMF from the ABBA received together with the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message and the new KSEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI value received together with the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message in subclause 5.4.1.2.4.2 in the volatile memory of the ME. If the KAMF and the partial native 5G NAS security context are created the ME shall store the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context and shall send an EAPresponseAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
NOTE 2 Generation of the new KAUSF and the new KSEAF does not result into deletion of the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any.
The ME shall not use the new KAUSF in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container if any are received until receipt of an EAPsuccess message.
If the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message contains AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute the UE may include AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute in the EAPresponseAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
5.4.1.2.2.4 Errors when handling EAPrequestAKAchallenge message
If a USIM is present the SNN check fails or the UE does not accept AUTN during handling of the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 the UE shall send an EAPresponseAKAauthenticationreject message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
If a USIM is present the SNN check is successful but the UE detects that the sequence number in AUTN is not correct during handling of the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 the UE shall send an EAPresponseAKAsynchronizationfailure message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
If a USIM is present the SNN check is successful the sequence number in AUTN is correct and the UE detects another error during handling of the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 the UE shall send an EAPresponseAKAclienterror message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
If a USIM is not present the UE shall send an EAPresponseAKAclienterror message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
For any of the above the UE shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAPresponse message is sent. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the timers T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running. Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequestAKAchallenge from the network the UE shall stop timer T3520 if running and then process the EAPrequestAKAchallenge information as normal.
5.4.1.2.2.5 Network successfully authenticates UE
Upon reception of the EAPresponseAKAchallenge message if procedures for handling an EAPresponseAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 are successful and
a the AUSF acts as the EAPAKA server the AUSF shall generate EMSK the KAUSF from the EMSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 or
b the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAPAKA server the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall generate MSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501
and

b if the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS
1 included the AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute in the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message and the AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute is not included in the EAPresponseAKAchallenge message or
2 did not include the AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute in the EAPrequestAKAchallenge message
then the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall send an EAPsuccess message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 and shall consider the procedure complete.
NOTE 1 When the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAPAKA server the AAA server of the CH or the DCS provides via the NSSAAF the MSK and the SUPI to the AUSF. Upon reception of the MSK the AUSF generates the KAUSF from the MSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 2 The AUSF provides the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI unless the SEAF provided the AUSF with the SUPI before to the SEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . Upon reception of the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI the SEAF generates the KAMF based on the ABBA the KSEAF and the SUPI as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and provides ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. Upon reception of the ngKSI and the KAMF the AMF creates a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI and stores the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.

In the EAPResponseIdentity message the UE shall provide the requested identity according to 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause F.2 in the UE identity in the EAPResponseIdentity message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with EAPRequestAKAIdentity message the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with EAPResponseAKAIdentity to the network. Based on the attribute received in the EAPRequestAKAIdentity the UE shall provide the requested identity according to 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause F.2 in the EAPResponseAKAIdentity message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
If the EAPRequestAKAIdentity carries the AT\_PERMANENT\_REQ the UE shall respond with EAPResponseAKAClientError with the error code unable to process packet.
5.4.1.2.2.7 Network sending EAPsuccess message
Upon reception of the EAPresponseAKAnotification message if earlier procedures for handling an EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 were successful the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall send an EAPsuccess message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 and shall consider the procedure complete.
NOTE The AUSF provides the KSEAF to the SEAF. Upon reception of the KSEAF the SEAF generates the KAMF based on the ABBA and the KSEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and provides ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. Upon reception of the ngKSI and the KAMF the AMF creates a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI and stores the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.
5.4.1.2.2.8 UE handling EAPsuccess message
Upon receiving an EAPsuccess message the ME shall
a delete the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any
b if the ME has not generated a new KAUSF and a new KSEAF and has not created a partial native 5G NAS security context as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.3
1 if the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and the credentials in the USIM contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then generate a new KAUSF from the MSK otherwise generate a new KAUSF from the EMSK
NOTE When the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN credentials in the USIM do not contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
2 generate a new KSEAF from the new KAUSF and the KAMF from the ABBA that was received with the EAPsuccess message and the new KSEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501
3 create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI value in the volatile memory of the ME and
4 store the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context and
c consider the new KAUSF to be the valid KAUSF and the new KSEAF to be the valid KSEAF reset the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter to zero and store the valid KAUSF the valid KSEAF the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter as specified in annex C and use the valid KAUSF in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container if any are received.
The UE shall consider the procedure complete.
5.4.1.2.2.9 Network not successfully authenticates UE
Upon reception of the EAPresponseAKAchallenge message if procedures for handling an EAPresponseAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 are not successful the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall send an EAPrequestAKAnotification message that implies failure as specified in IETF RFC 5448 .
5.4.1.2.2.10 Network sending EAPfailure message
Upon reception of the EAPresponseAKAnotification message if earlier procedures for handling an EAPrequestAKAchallenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 were not successful the AUSF or the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall send an EAPfailure message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 and shall consider the procedure complete.
If the authentication response RES returned by the UE in the AT\_RES attribute of the EAPresponseAKAchallenge message is not valid the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message that is
a if the 5GGUTI was used or
b if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should transport the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should transport the EAPfailure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure.
Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services if the UE initiates a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration and the AMF is configured to allow emergency registration without user identity the AMF needs not follow the procedures specified for transporting the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure in the present subclause. The AMF may include the EAPfailure message in a response of the current 5GMM specific procedure or in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT of the EAP result message transport procedure.
5.4.1.2.2.11 UE handling EAPfailure message
Upon receiving an EAPfailure message the UE shall delete the partial native 5G NAS security context and shall delete the new KAUSF and the new KSEAF if any were created as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.3.

5.4.1.2.2.12 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a EAPrequestAKAchallenge message with the key derivation function indicated in AT\_KDF attributes set to a value other than 1.
The UE shall act as specified in IETF RFC 5448 subclause 3.2 for the case when the AUTN had been incorrect.
###### 5.4.1.2.3	EAP-TLS related procedures
5.4.1.2.3.1 General
The UE may support acting as EAPTLS peer as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AUSF may support acting as EAPTLS server as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AAA server of the CH or the DCS may support acting as EAP server of such EAP method as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
The EAPTLS enables mutual authentication of the UE and the network.
When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAPTLS the network shall select an ngKSI value. If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM procedure the network shall select a different ngKSI value. The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the UE along with each EAP message. The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause 9.11.3.10 to the UE along with the EAPrequest message and EAPsuccess message.
When the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure uses EAPTLS
a if the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and
1 the default UE credentials for primary authentication if the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN or
2 credentials in the selected entry of the list of subscriber data if the UE is not registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN
contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the ME shall generate MSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 otherwise the ME shall generate EMSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501
b if the AUSF acts as the EAPTLS server the AUSF shall generate EMSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and
c if the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAPTLS server the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall generate MSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
When handling of an EAPrequest message results into generation of MSK or EMSK if the UE operates in SNPN access operation mode and
a the default UE credentials for primary authentication if the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN or
b credentials in the selected entry of the list of subscriber data if the UE is not registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN
contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the MSK otherwise the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the EMSK.
If the ME generates a new KAUSF the ME shall generate a new KSEAF from the new KAUSF and the KAMF from the ABBA received together with the EAPrequest message and the new KSEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI value received together with the EAPrequest message in subclause 5.4.1.2.4.2 in the volatile memory of the ME. If the KAMF and the partial native 5G NAS security context are created the ME shall store the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.
NOTE 1 Generation of the new KAUSF and the new KSEAF does not result into deletion of the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any.
The ME shall not use the new KAUSF in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container if any are received until receipt of an EAPsuccess message.
When the AUSF acts as the EAPTLS server and handling of an EAP response message results into generation of EMSK the AUSF shall generate the KAUSF from the EMSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 2 When the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAPTLS server the AAA server of the CH or the DCS provides via the NSSAAF the MSK and the SUPI to the AUSF. Upon reception of the MSK the AUSF generates the KAUSF from the MSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 3 The AUSF provides the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI unless the SEAF provided the AUSF with the SUPI before to the SEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . Upon reception of the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI the SEAF generates the KAMF based on the ABBA the KSEAF and the SUPI as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and provides ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. Upon reception of the ngKSI and the KAMF the AMF creates a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI and stores the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.
If the UE does not accept the server certificate of the network the UE shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAPresponse message is sent. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequest message from the network the UE shall stop timer T3520 if running and then process the EAPrequest message as normally.
If the network does not accept the client certificate of the UE the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message that is
if the 5GGUTI was used or
if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should transport the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should transport the EAPfailure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure.
Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services if the UE initiates a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration and the AMF is configured to allow emergency registration without user identity the AMF needs not follow the procedures specified for transporting the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure in the present subclause.

###### 5.4.1.2.3A	Procedures related to EAP methods other than EAP-AKA' and EAP-TLS
5.4.1.2.3A.1 General
This subclause applies when an EAP method
a supporting mutual authentication
b supporting EMSK or MSK generation and
c other than EAPAKA and EAPTLS
is used for primary authentication and key agreement in an SNPN.
The UE may support acting as EAP peer of such EAP method as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AUSF may support acting as EAP server of such EAP method as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AAA server of the CH or the DCS may support acting as EAP server of such EAP method as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using such EAP method the network shall select an ngKSI value. If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM procedure the network shall select a different ngKSI value. The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the UE along with each EAP message. The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause 9.11.3.10 to the UE along with the EAPrequest message and EAPsuccess message.
When the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure uses such EAP method
a if
1 the default UE credentials for primary authentication if the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN or
2 credentials in the selected entry of the list of subscriber data if the UE is not registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN
contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the ME shall generate MSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 otherwise the ME shall generate EMSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501
b if the AUSF acts as the EAP server the AUSF shall generate EMSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and
c if the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAP server the AAA server of the CH or the DCS shall generate MSK as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
When handling of an EAPrequest message results into generation of MSK or EMSK if
a the default UE credentials for primary authentication if the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN or
b credentials in the selected entry of the list of subscriber data if the UE is not registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN
contain an indication to use MSK for derivation of KAUSF after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure then the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the MSK otherwise the ME may generate a new KAUSF from the EMSK.
If the ME generates a new KAUSF the ME shall generate a new KSEAF from the new KAUSF and the KAMF from the ABBA received together with the EAPrequest message and the new KSEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI value received together with the EAPrequest message in subclause 5.4.1.2.4.2 in the volatile memory of the ME. If the KAMF and the partial native 5G NAS security context are created the ME shall store the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.
NOTE 1 Generation of the new KAUSF and the new KSEAF does not result into deletion of the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any.
The ME shall not use the new KAUSF in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container if any are received until receipt of an EAPsuccess message.
When the AUSF acts as the EAP server and handling of an EAP response message results into generation of EMSK the AUSF shall generate the KAUSF from the EMSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 2 When the AAA server of the CH or the DCS acts as the EAP server and handling of an EAP response message results into generation of MSK the AAA server of the CH or the DCS provides via the NSSAAF the MSK and the SUPI to the AUSF. Upon reception of the MSK the AUSF generates the KAUSF from the MSK and the KSEAF from the KAUSF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 3 The AUSF provides the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI unless the SEAF provided the AUSF with the SUPI before to the SEAF as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . Upon reception of the KSEAF and optionally the SUPI the SEAF generates the KAMF based on the ABBA the KSEAF and the SUPI as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 and provides ngKSI and the KAMF to the AMF. Upon reception of the ngKSI and the KAMF the AMF creates a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the ngKSI and stores the KAMF in the created partial native 5G NAS security context.
If the UE fails to authenticate the network the UE shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAPresponse message is sent. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequest message from the network the UE shall stop timer T3520 if running and then process the EAPrequest message as normally.
If the network fails to authenticate the UE the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message that is
if the 5GGUTI was used or
if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should transport the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should transport the EAPfailure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure.
If the EAPfailure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message

###### 5.4.1.2.3B	Procedures related to EAP methods used for primary authentication of an N5GC device
5.4.1.2.3B.1 General
This subclause applies when an EAP method
a supporting mutual authentication and
b other than EAPAKA
is used for primary authentication of an N5GC device when an WAGF supports acting on behalf of the N5GC device the AMF supports serving the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device and the AUSF supports authentication of the N5GC device. EAPTLS is an example of such EAP method.
NOTE 1 Neither the N5GC device nor the AUSF derive any 5G related keys during or after the primary authentication.
The AUSF supporting authentication of the N5GC device shall support acting as EAP server of at least one such EAP method as specified in annex O of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 2 The N5GC device supports acting as EAP peer of at least one such EAP method as specified in annex O of 3GPP TS 33.501 which is also supported by the AUSF.
The WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device provides to the N5GC device an EAPrequest message an EAPsuccess message or an EAPfailure message received from the network according to subclause 5.4.1.2.1 and sends to the network according to subclause 5.4.1.2.1 an EAPresponse provided by the N5GC device. The N5GC device can inform the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device that the N5GC device fails to authenticate the network. Details of communication between the N5GC device and the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device are out of scope of this specification.
When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using such EAP method the network shall select an ngKSI value. The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device along with each EAP message. The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause 9.11.3.10 to the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device along with the EAPrequest message and EAPsuccess message. The WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall not forward the ngKSI value or the ABBA value to the N5GC device.
NOTE 3 The network provides the ngKSI value and the ABBA value since the ngKSI IE and the ABBA IE are mandatory IEs in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. The WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device does not use the ngKSI value or the ABBA value provided by the network.
If the N5GC device fails to authenticate the network the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAPresponse message is sent. Furthermore the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequest message from the network the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall stop timer T3520 if running and then provides the EAPrequest message to the N5GC device as normally.
If the network fails to authenticate the N5GC device the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device in the initial NAS message that is
a if the 5GGUTI was used or
b if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should transport the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device after an unsuccessful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should transport the EAPfailure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure.
If the EAPfailure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall start timer T3247 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes if the timer is not running see subclause 5.3.20. Additionally the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall
a if the counter for USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over non3GPP access events has a value less than a WAGF implementationspecific maximum value proceed as specified in list item 1b of subclause 5.3.20.2 for the case that the 5GMM cause value received is #3 or
b otherwise set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED delete the stored 5GGUTI TAI list last visited registered TAI and ngKSI. The USIM shall be considered invalid for 5GS services via non3GPP access until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall abort any 5GMM signalling procedure stop any of the timers T3510 T3517 T3519 or T3521 if they were running enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI.
Upon receiving an EAPsuccess message the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall consider the procedure complete.
Upon receiving an EAPfailure message the WAGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall consider the procedure complete.
###### 5.4.1.2.3C	Procedures related to EAP methods used for primary authentication of an AUN3 device
5.4.1.2.3C.1 General
This subclause applies when an EAP method is used for primary authentication of an AUN3 device when a 5GRG supports acting on behalf of the AUN3 device the AMF supports serving the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device and the AUSF supports authentication of the AUN3 device. EAPAKA and EAPTLS are examples of such EAP method.
The AUSF supporting authentication of the AUN3 device shall support acting as EAP server of at least one such EAP method as specified in annex Z of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device provides to the AUN3 device an EAPrequest message an EAPsuccess message or an EAPfailure message received from the network according to subclause 5.4.1.2.1 and sends to the network according to subclause 5.4.1.2.1 an EAPresponse provided by the AUN3 device. Details of communication between the AUN3 device and the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device are out of scope of this specification.
When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using such EAP method the network shall select an ngKSI value. The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device along with each EAP message. The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause 9.11.3.10 to the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device along with the EAPrequest message and EAPsuccess message. The 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall not forward the ngKSI value or the ABBA value to the AUN3 device.
NOTE 1 The network provides the ngKSI value and the ABBA value since the ngKSI IE and the ABBA IE are mandatory IEs in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. The 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device does not use the ngKSI value or the ABBA value provided by the network.
If the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device is informed by AUN3 about failure to authenticate the network the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAPresponse message is sent. Furthermore the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequest message from the network the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall stop timer T3520 if running and then provides the EAPrequest message to the AUN3 device as normally.
If the network fails to authenticate the AUN3 device the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device in the initial NAS message that is
a if the 5GGUTI was used or
b if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should transport the EAPfailure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message as specified in the EAP result message transport procedure initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device after an unsuccessful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should transport the EAPfailure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message as specified in the EAP result message transport procedure.
If the EAPfailure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall start timer T3247 with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes if the timer is not running see subclause 5.3.20. Additionally the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall
a if the counter for USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over non3GPP access events has a value less than a 5GRG implementationspecific maximum value proceed as specified in list item 1b of subclause 5.3.20.2 for the case that the 5GMM cause value received is #3 or
b otherwise set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED delete the stored 5GGUTI TAI list last visited registered TAI and ngKSI. The USIM shall be considered invalid for 5GS services via non3GPP access until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall abort any 5GMM signalling procedure stop any of the timers T3510 T3517 T3519 or T3521 if they were running enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI.
Upon receiving an EAPsuccess message from the network the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall consider the procedure complete. The network shall provide
a the Master session key if the AUN3 device does not support 5G key hierarchy or
b the KWAGF key if the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy
to the 5GRG along with the EAPsuccess message as specified in subclauses 5.4.1.2.5.2 and 5.4.2.2. The 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall derive the Pairwise master key from the Master session key or the KWAGF key as specified in subclause 7B.7 of 3GPP TS 33.501 . The 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device provides the EAPsuccess message to the AUN3 device.
NOTE 2 The network is aware from the AUN3 device subscription data in UDM whether the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy or not as specified in subclause 7B.7 of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Upon receiving an EAPfailure message from the network the 5GRG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall consider the procedure complete.
###### 5.4.1.2.4	EAP message reliable transport procedure
5.4.1.2.4.1 General
The purpose of the EAP message reliable transport procedure is to provide a reliable transport of an EAPrequest message the ngKSI and the ABBA from the network to the UE and of an EAPresponse message from the UE to the network.
The EAP message reliable transport procedure is initiated by an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE.
5.4.1.2.4.2 EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation by the network
In order to initiate the EAP message reliable transport procedure the AMF shall create an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the EAPrequest message to be sent to the UE. The AMF shall set the ngKSI IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the ngKSI value selected in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.2 subclause 5.4.1.2.3.1 or subclause 5.4.1.2.3A.1. In this release of specification the AMF shall set the ABBA IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the length of ABBA IE to 2 and the ABBA contents to be 2 octets in length with value 0000H as described in subclause 9.11.3.10.
The AMF shall send the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and the AMF shall start timer T3560 see example in figure 5.4.1.2.4.2.1.
Figure 5.4.1.2.4.2.1 EAP message reliable transport procedure
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE the UE handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE and the ABBA of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
####### 5.4.1.2.4.3	EAP message reliable transport procedure accepted by the UE
The UE shall create an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message.
If the received EAP message is an EAPrequest message the UE shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the EAPresponse message responding to the received EAPrequest message.
The UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the AMF.
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message the AMF shall stop timer T3560. If the EAP message IE is included in the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message the AMF handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message.
####### 5.4.1.2.4.4	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Expiry of timer T3560.
The AMF shall on the first expiry of the timer T3560 retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3560. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3560 the AMF shall abort the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and any ongoing 5GMM specific procedure and release the N1 NAS signalling connection.
b Lower layers indication of nondelivered NAS PDU due to handover.
If the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. If a failure of handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists the AMF shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
####### 5.4.1.2.4.5	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Authentication failure 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use.
The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use to the network and start the timer T3520 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use the network performs necessary actions to select a new ngKSI and send the same EAPrequest message to the UE.
NOTE 1 Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use the network can also reinitiate the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1.2.2.2.
Upon receiving a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAPrequest message from the network the UE shall stop timer T3520 if running process the EAPrequest message as normal.
If the network is validated successfully an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid ngKSI and EAPrequest message is received the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
b Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers if the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by a registration procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running and reinitiate the registration procedure.
c Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with change in the current TAI if the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running.
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure shall be aborted and a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be initiated.
If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list it is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
d Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication without change in the current TAI if the authentication procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running. It is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
e Network failing the authentication check.
If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred see 3GPP TS 38.304 or 3GPP TS 36.304 25C. The UE shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an ngKSI that was already in use.
f Change in the current TAI.
If that the current TAI is not in the TAI list before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is sent the UE may discard sending the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and continue with the initiation of the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.2.
For item e if no emergency service is started or is ongoing
The UE shall stop timer T3520 if the timer is running and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or as the result of an intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.
The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as described in item e above if any of the following occurs
the timer T3520 expires
the UE detects any combination of the EAPbased authentication failures transmission of AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use transmission of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with an EAPresponse message after detecting an error as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.4 with an EAPresponse message after not accepting of the server certificate as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.3.1 or with an EAPresponse message after failing to authenticate the network as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.3A.1 during three consecutive authentication challenges. The EAPrequestAKAchallenge challenges shall be considered as consecutive only if the EAPrequestAKAchallenge challenges causing the second and third EAPbased authentication failure are received by the UE while the timer T3520 started after the previous EAPbased authentication failure is running. Not accepting of the server certificate shall be considered as consecutive only if the EAPrequest messages causing the second and third not accepting of the server certificate are received by the UE while the timer T3520 started after the previous EAP request message causing the previous not accepting of the server certificate is running.
NOTE 2 Reception of an EAPfailure message is not considered when determining the three consecutive authentication challenges or three consecutive not accepting of the server certificate.
For item e if there is an emergency service started or is ongoin
The UE shall stop timer T3520 if the timer is running and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or as the result of an intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.
If a UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session and sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the AMF with the 5GMM cause appropriate for this cases i.e. #71 or an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing an EAPresponse message as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.4 containing an EAPresponse message after not accepting of the server certificate as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.3.1 or containing an EAPresponse message after failing to authenticate the network as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.3A.1 and receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message before the timeout of timer T3520 the UE shall deem that the network has passed the authentication check successfully stop timer T3520 respectively and execute the security mode control procedure.
If a UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session when timer T3520 expires the UE shall not deem that the network has failed the authentication check and not behave as described in item e. Instead the UE shall continue using the current security context if any release all nonemergency PDU sessions if any by initiating UErequested PDU session release procedure. If there is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure the UE shall release all nonemergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session establishment procedure.
The UE shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure and
the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been completed.
The UE shall consider itself to be registered for emergency services.
###### 5.4.1.2.5	EAP result message transport procedure
5.4.1.2.5.1 General
The purpose of the EAP result message transport procedure is to provide an EAPsuccess message or an EAPfailure message and ngKSI from the network to the UE when the EAP message cannot be piggybacked by another NAS message.
The EAP result message transport procedure is initiated
a by an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message with the EAP message IE carrying the EAPsuccess message or the EAPfailure message or
b by an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message with the EAP message IE carrying the EAPfailure message.
5.4.1.2.5.2 EAP result message transport procedure initiation by the network
In order to initiate the EAP result message transport procedure the AMF shall create an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to an EAPsuccess message or an EAPfailure message to be sent to the UE. If the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message is provided to a 5GRG that is acting on behalf of an AUN3 device and the EAP message IE is set to an EAPsuccess message the AMF shall include the AUN3 device security key IE in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message with its value set to
a the Master session key if the AUN3 device does not support 5G key hierarchy or
b the KWAGF key if the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy.
NOTE The network is aware from the AUN3 device subscription data in UDM whether the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy or not as specified in subclause 7B.7 of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to an EAPfailure message to be sent to the UE. The AMF shall set the ngKSI IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the ngKSI value selected in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.2 subclause 5.4.1.2.3.1 or subclause 5.4.1.2.3A.1.
The AMF shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE see example in figure 5.4.1.2.5.2.1.
Figure 5.4.1.2.5.2.1 EAP result message transport procedure
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message with the EAP message IE the UE handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE and the ABBA if received of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or in the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message and the 5GRG that is acting on behalf of an AUN3 device handles the AUN3 device security key IE if received in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message.
###### 5.4.1.3.1	General
The purpose of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to agree on the keys KAUSF KSEAF and KAMF see 3GPP TS 33.501 . The cases when the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is used are defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
The network initiates the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE without the EAP message IE. The network shall include the ngKSI and the ABBA in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. However the UE can reject the 5G authentication challenge sent by the network.
The UE shall proceed with a 5G authentication challenge only if a USIM is present.
A partial native 5G NAS security context is established in the UE and the network when a 5G authentication is successfully performed. During a successful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the CK and IK are computed by the USIM. CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to compute new keys KAUSF KSEAF and KAMF. KAMF is stored in the 5G NAS security contexts see 3GPP TS 33.501 of both the network and in the volatile memory of the ME while registered to the network and is the root for the 5GS integrity protection and ciphering key hierarchy.
NOTE 1 Generation of the new KAUSF and the new KSEAF does not result into deletion of the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any.
Upon successful completion of the 5G AKA based primary authentication the AMF shall initiate a security mode control procedure see subclause 5.4.2 to take the new partial native 5G NAS security context into use.
NOTE 2 The AMF immediately initiates a security mode control procedure see subclause 5.4.2 after 5G AKA primary authentication is successful to avoid KAUSF key mismatch between the UE and the network.
###### 5.4.1.3.2	Authentication initiation by the network
The network may initiate a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure for a UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode at any time. For restrictions applicable after handover or intersystem change to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode see subclause 5.5.1.3.3.
The network initiates the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3560 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.2.1. The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message shall contain the parameters necessary to calculate the authentication response see 3GPP TS 33.501 . This message shall include the ngKSI that will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the KAMF and the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful. This message shall also include the ABBA parameter. In this release of specification the network shall set the length of ABBA IE to 2 and the ABBA contents to be 2 octets in length with value 0000H as described in subclause 9.11.3.10.
If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM procedure the network shall include a different ngKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
Figure 5.4.1.3.2.1 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure
###### 5.4.1.3.3	Authentication response by the UE
The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. With the exception of the cases described in subclause 5.4.1.3.6 and 5.4.1.3.7 case l the UE shall process the 5G authentication challenge data and respond with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.
Upon a successful 5G authentication challenge the UE shall determine the PLMN identity in case of PLMN or the SNPN identity in case of SNPN to be used for the calculation of the new KAMF from the 5G authentication challenge data according to the following rules
a When the UE moves from 5GMMIDLE mode to 5GMMCONNECTED mode until the first handover the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN or the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN and
b After handover or intersystem change to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode
1 if the target cell is not a shared network cell the UE shall use the PLMN identity in case of PLMN or the SNPN identity in case of SNPN received as part of the broadcast system information
2 if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall use the PLMN identity in case of PLMN or the SNPN identity in case of SNPN that is part of the 5GGUTI and
3 if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid 4GGUTI but not a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 4GGUTI.
Upon a successful 5G authentication challenge the new KAMF calculated from the 5G authentication challenge data shall be stored in a new 5G NAS security context in the volatile memory of the ME.
The USIM will compute the authentication response RES using the 5G authentication challenge data received from the ME and pass RES to the ME. From the RES RES* is then generated according to annex A of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
In order to avoid a synchronisation failure when the UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message the UE shall store the received RAND together with the RES* in the volatile memory of the ME. When the UE receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message if the stored RAND value is equal to the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message then the ME shall not pass the RAND to the USIM but shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES*. If there is no valid stored RAND in the ME or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message the ME shall pass the RAND to the USIM shall override any previously stored RAND and RES* with the new ones and start or reset and restart timer T3516.
The RAND and RES* values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer T3516 if running shall be stopped
a upon receipt of a
1 SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
2 SERVICE REJECT message
3 REGISTRATION REJECT message
4 REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
5 AUTHENTICATION REJECT message or
6 SERVICE ACCEPT message
b upon expiry of timer T3516
c if the UE enters the 5GMM state 5GMMDEREGISTERED or 5GMMNULL or
d if the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode.
###### 5.4.1.3.4	Authentication completion by the network
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message the network stops the timer T3560 and checks the correctness of RES* see 3GPP TS 33.501 .
If the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure has been completed successfully and the related ngKSI is stored in the 5G NAS security context of the network the network shall include a different ngKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates a new 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message the network stops the timer T3560. In the case where the 5GMM cause #21 synch failure is received the core network may renegotiate with the UDMAUSF and provide the UE with new authentication parameters.
###### 5.4.1.3.5	Authentication not accepted by the network
If the authentication response RES returned by the UE is not valid the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message that is
if the 5GGUTI was used or
if the SUCI was used.
If the 5GGUTI was used the network should initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI.
If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE. The network shall maintain if any the 5GMMcontext and 5G NAS security context of the UE unchanged.
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message
1 if the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS
the UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED delete the stored 5GGUTI TAI list last visited registered TAI ngKSI the list of equivalent PLMNs if any and the list of equivalent SNPNs if any. Additionally if a registration procedure was performed the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter or if a service request procedure was performed the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter.
In case of PLMN the USIM shall be considered invalid until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
In case of SNPN if the UE is neither registered for onboarding services in SNPN nor performing initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN and the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and does not support equivalent SNPNs the entry of the list of subscriber data with the SNPN identity of the current SNPN shall be considered invalid until the UE is switched off or the entry is updated. Additionally the UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for the current SNPN until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
In case of SNPN if the UE is neither registered for onboarding services in SNPN nor performing initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN and the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both the UE shall consider the selected entry of the list of subscriber data as invalid for 3GPP access until the UE is switched off or the entry is updated. Additionally the UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for the entry until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
In case of SNPN if the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN or is performing initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall store the SNPN identity in the permanently forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN list enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform an SNPN selection or an SNPN selection for onboarding services according to 3GPP TS 23.122 and

the counter for the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid for non3GPP access events to UE implementationspecific maximum value in case of SNPN.
If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN or performing initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall
1 if the SNPNspecific attempt counter for the SNPN sending the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message has a value less than a UE implementationspecific maximum value increment the SNPNspecific attempt counter for the SNPN or
2 otherwise the UE shall set the update status to 5U3.ROAMING NOT ALLOWED delete the stored 5GGUTI TAI list last visited registered TAI and ngKSI store the SNPN identity in the permanently forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN list enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform an SNPN selection or an SNPN selection for onboarding services according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE the UE shall abort any 5GMM signalling procedure stop any of the timers T3510 T3516 T3517 T3519 T3520 or T3521 if they were running enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI.
Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services if the UE initiates a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration and the AMF is configured to allow emergency registration without user identity the AMF needs not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present subclause. The AMF may continue a current 5GMM specific procedure.
###### 5.4.1.3.6	Authentication not accepted by the UE
In the 5G authentication challenge the UE shall check the 5G authentication challenge data RAND AUTN and ngKSI received in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to verify authenticity of the 5G core network.
The ME shall check that ngKSI received in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is not already in use. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN to the USIM to check.
The UE may reject the core network due to an incorrect AUTN or ngKSI parameter. If the UE has to reject the 5G authentication challenge the UE shall return AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure see 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Incorrect 5G authentication challenge data contains four possible causes for authentication failure
a MAC code failure
If the UE finds the MAC code supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter to be invalid the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with the 5GMM cause #20 MAC failure. The UE shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7 item c.
b Non5G authentication unacceptable
If the UE finds that the separation bit in the AMF field of AUTN supplied by the core network is set to 0 the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with the 5GMM cause #26 non5G authentication unacceptable see subclause 6.1.3 in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The UE shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7 item d.
c ngKSI already in use
If the UE detects that ngKSI received in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is already in use in the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with the 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use. The UE shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7 item e.
d SQN failure
If the UE finds the sequence number SQN supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter to be out of range the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with the 5GMM cause #21 synch failure and a resynchronization token AUTS provided by the USIM see 3GPP TS 33.102 . The UE shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7 item f.
If the UE returns an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network the UE shall delete any previously stored RAND and RES* and shall stop timer T3516 if running.
If the UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing such a PDU session additional UE requirements are specified in subclause 5.4.1.3.7 under for items c d e and f.
###### 5.4.1.3.7	Abnormal cases
a Lower layer failure.
Upon detection of lower layer failure before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is received the network shall abort the procedure.
b Expiry of timer T3560.
The network shall on the first expiry of the timer T3560 retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3560. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3560 the network shall abort the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and any ongoing 5GMM specific procedure and release the N1 NAS signalling connection.
c Authentication failure 5GMM cause #20 MAC failure.
The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #20 MAC failure according to subclause 5.4.1.3.6 to the network and start timer T3520 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #20 MAC failure the network may initiate the identification procedure described in subclause 5.4.3. This is to allow the network to obtain the SUCI from the UE. The network may then check that the 5GGUTI originally used in the 5G authentication challenge corresponded to the correct SUPI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.4.3.3.
NOTE 1 Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #20 MAC failure the network may also terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If the mapping of 5GGUTI to SUPI in the network was incorrect the network should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from the network the UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running and then process the 5G challenge information as normal. If the mapping of 5GGUTI to SUPI in the network was correct the network should terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message see subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If the network is validated successfully an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid SQN and MAC is received the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and the MAC value cannot be resolved the UE shall follow the procedure specified in this subclause item c starting again from the beginning or if the message contains a UMTS authentication challenge the UE shall follow the procedure specified in item d. If the SQN is invalid the UE shall proceed as specified in item f.
Figure 5.4.1.3.7.1 Authentication failure during 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure
d Authentication failure 5GMM cause #26 non5G authentication unacceptable.
The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #26 non5G authentication unacceptable to the network and start the timer T3520 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #26 non5G authentication unacceptable the network may initiate the identification procedure described in subclause 5.4.3. This is to allow the network to obtain the SUCI from the UE. The network may then check that the 5GGUTI originally used in the 5G authentication challenge corresponded to the correct SUPI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.4.3.3.
NOTE 2 Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #26 non5G authentication unacceptable the network may also terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If the mapping of 5GGUTI to SUPI in the network was incorrect the network should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from the network the UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running and then process the 5G challenge information as normal. If the mapping of 5GGUTI to SUPI in the network was correct the network should terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message see subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
If the network is validated successfully an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid 5G authentication challenge is received the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
e Authentication failure 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use.
The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use to the network and start the timer T3520 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use the network performs necessary actions to select a new ngKSI and send the same 5G authentication challenge to the UE.
NOTE 3 Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 ngKSI already in use the network may also reinitiate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure see subclause 5.4.1.3.2.
Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from the network the UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running and then process the 5G challenge information as normal.
If the network is validated successfully an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message that contains a valid ngKSI SQN and MAC is received the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
f Authentication failure 5GMM cause #21 synch failure.
The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #21 synch failure to the network and start the timer T3520 see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1. Furthermore the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521. Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with the 5GMM cause #21 synch failure the network shall use the returned AUTS parameter from the authentication failure parameter IE in the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to resynchronise. The resynchronisation procedure requires the AMF to delete all unused authentication vectors for that SUPI and obtain new vectors from the UDMAUSF. When resynchronisation is complete the network shall initiate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message the UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running.
NOTE 4 Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages from the UE with 5GMM cause #21 synch failure the network may terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.
If the network is validated successfully a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is received which contains a valid SQN and MAC while T3520 is running the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message the UE shall perform the actions as specified in subclause 5.4.1.3.5.
g Network failing the authentication check.
If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred see 3GPP TS 38.304 or 3GPP TS 36.304 25C. The UE shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an incorrect authentication challenge data causing authentication failure.
h Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers if the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by a registration procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running and reinitiate the registration procedure.
i Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with change in the current TAI if the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running.
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure shall be aborted and a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be initiated.
If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list it is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
j Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication without change in the current TAI if the authentication procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
The UE shall stop the timer T3520 if running. It is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
k Lower layers indication of nondelivered NAS PDU due to handover.
If the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. If a failure of handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists the AMF shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
l Change in the current TAI.
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is sent the UE may discard sending the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and continue with the initiation of the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.2.
m AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received without integrity protection and neither timer T3516 nor T3520 is running.
If an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received without integrity protection and if neither timer T3516 nor T3520 is running then the UE shall discard the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message. Additionally the UE may request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred see 3GPP TS 38.304 or 3GPP TS 36.304 25C.
For items c d e and f if no emergency service is started or is ongoing
The UE shall stop timer T3520 if the timer is running and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or as the result of an intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.
The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as described in item g above if any of the following occurs
the timer T3520 expires
the UE detects any combination of the 5G authentication failures 5GMM causes #20 MAC failure #21 synch failure #26 non5G authentication unacceptable or #71 ngKSI already in use during three consecutive authentication challenges. The 5G authentication challenges shall be considered as consecutive only if the 5G authentication challenges causing the second and third 5G authentication failure are received by the UE while the timer T3520 started after the previous 5G authentication failure is running.
For items c d e and f if there is an emergency service started or is ongoing
The UE shall stop timer T3520 if the timer is running and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or as the result of an intersystem change in 5GMMCONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.
If there is an ongoing
service request procedure for emergency services fallback the UE shall abort the service request procedure stop timer T3517 and locally release any resources allocated for the service request procedure and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED or
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update triggered upon a request from the upper layers to perform an emergency services fallback procedure the UE shall abort the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update stop timer T3510 and locally release any resources allocated for the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED and
the UE shall attempt to select an EUTRA cell connected to EPC or 5GCN according to the domain priority and selection rules specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 . If the UE finds a suitable EUTRA cell it proceeds with the appropriate EMM or 5GMM procedures. If the UE operating in singleregistration mode has changed to S1 mode it shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access.
Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services if the UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session the AMF need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure specified in the present subclause. The AMF may respond to the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message by initiating the security mode control procedure selecting the null integrity protection algorithm 5GIA0 null ciphering algorithm 5GEA0 or may abort the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and continue using the current security context if any. The AMF shall indicate to the SMF to perform the release of all nonemergency PDU sessions if any. If there is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure the AMF shall indicate to the SMF to perform the release of all nonemergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session establishment procedure. The network shall behave as if the UE is registered for emergency services.
If a UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session and sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the AMF with the 5GMM cause appropriate for these cases #20 #21 #26 or #71 respectively and receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message before the timeout of timer T3520 the UE shall deem that the network has passed the authentication check successfully stop timer T3520 respectively and execute the security mode control procedure.
If a UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session when timer T3520 expires the UE shall not deem that the network has failed the authentication check and not behave as described in item g. Instead the UE shall continue using the current security context if any release all nonemergency PDU sessions if any by initiating UErequested PDU session release procedure. If there is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure the UE shall release all nonemergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session establishment procedure.
The UE shall start any retransmission timers e.g. T3510 T3517 or T3521 if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure and
the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been completed.
The UE shall behave as if the UE is registered for emergency services.
##### 5.4.2.1	General
The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G NAS security context into use and initialise and start NAS signalling security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys and 5G NAS security algorithms.
Furthermore the network may also initiate the security mode control procedure in the following cases
a in order to change the 5G NAS security algorithms for a current 5G NAS security context already in use
b in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause 6.9.4.4 and
c in order to provide the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the UE.
For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode control procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or inside the core network see 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause 6.9.5.
If the security mode control procedure is initiated after successful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the security mode control procedure intends to bring into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the UE accepts received security mode command see subclause 5.4.2.3 the ME shall
a delete the valid KAUSF and the valid KSEAF if any and
b consider the new KAUSF to be the valid KAUSF and the new KSEAF to be the valid KSEAF reset the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter to zero and store the valid KAUSF the valid KSEAF the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter as specified in annex C and use the valid KAUSF in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container if any are received.
NOTE The AMF does not perform a security mode control procedure when the 5G AKA based primary authentication procedure successfully authenticates a 5G ProSe layer3 remote UE accessing the network via a 5G ProSe layer3 UEtonetwork relay UE served by the AMF.
##### 5.4.2.2	NAS security mode control initiation by the network
The AMF initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer T3560 see example in figure 5.4.2.2.
The AMF shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the security mode control procedure is initiated
a to take into use the security context created after a successful execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
b upon receipt of REGISTRATION REQUEST message if the AMF needs to create a mapped 5G NAS security context i.e. the type of security context flag is set to mapped security context in the ngKSI IE included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message unciphered but shall integrity protect the message with the 5G NAS integrity key based on KAMF or mapped KAMF indicated by the ngKSI included in the message. The AMF shall set the security header type of the message to integrity protected with new 5G NAS security context.
The AMF shall create a locally generated KAMF and send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including an ngKSI value in the ngKSI IE set to 000 and 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms only when the security mode control procedure is initiated
a during an initial registration procedure for emergency services if no valid 5G NAS security context is available
b during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update for a UE that has an emergency PDU session if no valid 5G NAS security context is available
c during a service request procedure for a UE that has an emergency PDU session if no valid 5G NAS security context is available or
d after a failed primary authentication and key agreement procedure for a UE that has an emergency PDU session or is establishing an emergency PDU session if continued usage of a valid 5G NAS security context is not possible.
When the AMF sends the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including an ngKSI value in the ngKSI IE set to 000 and 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms if
a the AMF supports N26 interface
b the UE set the S1 mode bit to S1 mode supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and
c the security mode control procedure is initiated during an initial registration procedure for emergency services during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update for a UE that has an emergency PDU session or during a service request procedure for a UE that has an emergency PDU session
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall also include the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE. The selected EPS NAS security algorithms shall be set to EIA0 and EEA0.
The UE shall process a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including an ngKSI value in the ngKSI IE set to 000 and 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms and if accepted create a locally generated KAMF when the security mode control procedure is initiated
a during an initial registration procedure for emergency services
b during a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update for a UE that has an emergency PDU session
c during a service request procedure for a UE that has an emergency PDU session or
d after a primary authentication and key agreement procedure for a UE that has an emergency PDU session or is establishing an emergency PDU session.
NOTE 1 The process for creation of the locally generated KAMF by the AMF and the UE is implementation dependent. The KAMF is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Upon receipt of a REGISTRATION REQUEST message if the AMF does not have the valid current 5G NAS security context indicated by the UE the AMF shall either
a indicate the use of the new mapped 5G NAS security context to the UE by setting the type of security context flag in the ngKSI IE to mapped security context and the KSI value related to the security context of the source system or
b set the ngKSI value to 000 in the ngKSI IE if the AMF sets 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms for a UE that has an emergency PDU session.
Upon receipt of a REGISTRATION REQUEST message if the AMF has the valid current 5G NAS security context indicated by the UE the AMF supports N26 interface and the UE set the S1 mode bit to S1 mode supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the UE is not registered for disaster roaming services the AMF shall check whether the selected EPS NAS security algorithms was successfully provided to the UE. If not the AMF shall initiate the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message with the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE to the UE.
While having a current mapped 5G NAS security context with the UE if the AMF needs to take the native 5G NAS security context into use the AMF shall include the ngKSI that indicates the native 5G NAS security context in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
The AMF shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE including the security capabilities with regard to NAS RRC and UP user plane ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity and other possible target network security capabilities i.e. EUTRAN if the UE included them in the message to network the selected 5GS ciphering and integrity algorithms and the ngKSI.
If a UE is already registered over one access to a PLMN and the AMF decides to skip primary authentication and key agreement procedure when the UE attempts to register over the other access to the same PLMN the AMF shall take into use the UEs current 5G NAS security context over the other access that the UE is registering. In this case SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is not sent to the UE.
If the UE is registered to the same AMF and the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over both the 3GPP and non3GPP accesses then at any time the primary authentication and key agreement procedure has successfully completed over
a the 3GPP access the AMF includes the ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the 3GPP access. When the AMF sends the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to UE over the non3GPP access to take into use the new 5G NAS security context the AMF shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to identify the new 5G NAS security context or
b the non3GPP access the AMF includes the ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non3GPP access. When the AMF sends the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to UE over the 3GPP access to take into use the new 5G NAS security context the AMF shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to identify the new 5G NAS security context.
The AMF may initiate a SECURITY MODE COMMAND in order to change the 5G security algorithms for a current 5G NAS security context already in use. The AMF rederives the 5G NAS keys from KAMF with the new 5G algorithm identities as input and provides the new 5GS algorithm identities within the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. The AMF shall set the security header type of the message to integrity protected with new 5G NAS security context.
If during an ongoing registration procedure the AMF is initiating a SECURITY MODE COMMAND i.e. after receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message but before sending a response to that message and
a the REGISTRATION REQUEST message does not successfully pass the integrity check at the AMF or
b the AMF can not decipher the value part of the NAS message container IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
the AMF shall include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message requesting the UE to send the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
If during an ongoing deregistration procedure the AMF is initiating a SECURITY MODE COMMAND i.e. after receiving the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message but before sending a response to that message and
a the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message does not successfully pass the integrity check at the AMF or
b the AMF can not decipher the value part of the NAS message container IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message
the AMF shall include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message requesting the UE to send the entire DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
NOTE 2 The AMF uses the UE security capability which was provided by the UE.
If during an ongoing service request procedure for a UE with an emergency PDU session the AMF is initiating a SECURITY MODE COMMAND i.e. after receiving the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message but before sending a response to that message and the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message does not successfully pass the integrity check at the AMF the AMF shall include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message requesting the UE to send the entire
a SERVICE REQUEST message or
b CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message excluding noncleartext IEs except the Uplink data status IE if needed see subclause 5.4.2.3
in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Additionally the AMF may request the UE to include its IMEISV in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
If the AMF supports N26 interface and the UE set the S1 mode bit to S1 mode supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF needs to provide the selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the UE the AMF shall select ciphering and integrity algorithms to be used in the EPS and indicate them to the UE via the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
NOTE 3 The AS and NAS security capabilities are the same i.e. if the UE supports one algorithm for NAS the same algorithm is also supported for AS.
If the AMF performs horizontal key derivation e.g. during the mobility and periodic registration update or when the UE is already registered in the PLMN with another access type as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 the AMF shall include horizontal derivation parameter in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
If the security mode control procedure is initiated after successful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the security mode control procedure intends to bring into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure the AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to an EAPsuccess message to be sent to the UE. If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is provided to a 5GRG that is acting on behalf of an AUN3 device and the EAP message IE is set to an EAPsuccess message the AMF shall include the AUN3 device security key IE in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message with its value set to
a the Master session key if the AUN3 device does not support 5G key hierarchy or
b the KWAGF key if the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy.
NOTE 4 The network is aware from the AUN3 device subscription data in UDM whether the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy or not as specified in subclause 7B.7 of 3GPP TS 33.501 .
Figure 5.4.2.2 Security mode control procedure
##### 5.4.2.3	NAS security mode command accepted by the UE
Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message the UE shall check whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done by performing the integrity check of the message and by checking that the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE has not been altered compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network.
When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes an EAPsuccess message the UE handles the EAPsuccess message and the ABBA as described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.8 5.4.1.2.3.1 5.4.1.2.3A.1 5.4.1.2.3B.1 and 5.4.1.2.3C.1.

a the UE is registered for emergency services performing initial registration for emergency services establishing an emergency PDU session or has an emergency PDU session established
b the WAGF acts on behalf of the FNRG
c the WAGF acts on behalf of the N5GC device or
d the 5GRG acts on behalf of the AUN3 device
and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI value 000 and 5GIA0 and 5GEA0 as selected 5G NAS security algorithms the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security context. The UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.
The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the null integrity protection algorithm 5GIA0 as the selected 5G NAS integrity algorithm only if the message is received when
a the UE is registered for emergency services performing initial registration for emergency services establishing an emergency PDU session or has an emergency PDU session established
b the WAGF acts on behalf of the FNRG
c the WAGF acts on behalf of the N5GC device or
d the 5GRG acts on behalf of the AUN3 device.
If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is set to native security context and if the ngKSI matches a valid noncurrent native 5G NAS security context held in the UE while the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context as the current 5G NAS security context the UE shall take the noncurrent native 5G NAS security context into use which then becomes the current native 5G NAS security context and delete the mapped 5G NAS security context.
The UE shall ignore the Replayed S1 UE security capabilities IE if this IE is included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted the UE shall take the 5G NAS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if
a the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5G NAS security context into use created after a successful execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
b the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of security context flag set to mapped security context in the NAS key set identifier IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5G NAS security context if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new 5G NAS security context is taken into use and SECURITY MODE COMMAND message does not indicate the null integrity protection algorithm 5GIA0 as the selected NAS integrity algorithm the UE shall
if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity checked using an estimated downlink NAS COUNT equal to 0 then the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS security context to 0
otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS security context to the downlink NAS COUNT that has been used for the successful integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation parameter indicating KAMF derivation is required the UE shall derive a new KAMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 for KAMF to KAMF derivation in mobility and set both uplink and downlink NAS COUNTs to zero. When the new 5G NAS security context is taken into use for current access and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and the non3GPP access
a the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over the noncurrent access the AMF and the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context over the noncurrent access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for the noncurrent access or
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AMF shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to identify the new 5G NAS security context.
NOTE 1 If the UE was in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access when the new 5G NAS security context was taken into use for the current access and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode over the noncurrent access before receiving a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access the UE conforms to bullet a.
NOTE 2 If the UE was in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access when the new 5G NAS security context was taken into use and the N1 NAS signalling connection is lost over the noncurrent access before sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access the AMF conforms to bullet a.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation parameter indicating KAMF derivation is not required or the Additional 5G security information IE is not included in the message the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non3GPP access then after the completion of a security mode control procedure over the current access
a the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode over the noncurrent access the AMF and the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context for the noncurrent access. If a primary authentication and key agreement procedure was completed before the security mode control procedure the AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for the noncurrent access otherwise the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT for the non3GPP access are not changed or
b the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 . The AMF shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to identify the new 5G NAS security context.
NOTE 3 If the UE was in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access when the new 5G NAS security context was taken into use for the current access and the UE enters 5GMMIDLE mode over the noncurrent access before receiving a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access the UE conforms to bullet a.
NOTE 4 If the UE was in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over the noncurrent access when the new 5G NAS security context was taken into use and the N1 NAS signalling connection is lost over the noncurrent access before sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the noncurrent access the AMF conforms to bullet a.
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted the UE shall send a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected 5GS integrity algorithm and the 5G NAS integrity key based on the KAMF or mapped KAMF if the type of security context flag is set to mapped security context indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to mapped security context in the NAS key set identifier IE then the UE shall check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the ngKSI of the current 5GS security context if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context in order not to regenerate the KAMF.
Furthermore if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted the UE shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected 5GS ciphering algorithm and the 5GS NAS ciphering key based on the KAMF or mapped KAMF indicated by the ngKSI. The UE shall set the security header type of the message to integrity protected and ciphered with new 5G NAS security context.
From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering algorithms.
If the AMF indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the IMEISV is requested and
a if the UE
1 supports at least one 3GPP access technology the UE shall include its IMEISV in the IMEISV IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or
2 does not support any 3GPP access technology i.e. satellite NGRAN NGRAN satellite EUTRAN EUTRAN UTRAN or GERAN and supports NAS over untrusted or trusted non3GPP access the UE shall include its EUI64 in the nonIMEISV PEI IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or

1 the 5GRG contains neither an IMEISV nor an IMEI or when the 5GRG acts on behalf of the AUN3 device or
2 when the WAGF acts on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device
the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall include the MAC address and the MAC address usage restriction indication determined as specified in subclause 5.3.2 in the nonIMEISV PEI IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
If during an ongoing registration procedure deregistration procedure or service request procedure the UE receives a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message which includes the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested the UE shall include the entire unciphered REGISTRATION REQUEST message DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message which the UE had previously included in the NAS message container IE of the initial NAS message i.e. REGISTRATION REQUEST message DEREGISTRATION REQUEST MESSAGE SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message respectively in the NAS message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message. The retransmitted CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
a shall not include any noncleartext IE except the Uplink data status IE and
b may include the Uplink data status IE.
If prior to receiving the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message the UE without a valid 5G NAS security context had sent a REGISTRATION REQUEST message the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message in the NAS message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in subclause 4.4.6.
If the UE operating in the singleregistration mode receives the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE the UE shall use the IE according to 3GPP TS 33.501 .
For a UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the UE shall set the value of the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE in the 5G NAS security context to the NAS security algorithms that were received from the source MME when the UE was in S1 mode.
##### 5.4.2.4	NAS security mode control completion by the network
The AMF shall upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message stop timer T3560. From this time onward the AMF shall integrity protect and encipher all signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering algorithms.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a NAS message container IE with a REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF shall complete the ongoing registration procedure by considering the REGISTRATION REQUEST message contained in the NAS message container IE as the message that triggered the procedure.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a NAS message container IE with a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF shall complete the ongoing deregistration procedure by considering the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message contained in the NAS message container IE as the message that triggered the procedure.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a NAS message container IE with a REGISTRATION REQUEST message the 5GMM capability IE included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates S1 mode supported and the AMF supports N26 interface the AMF shall initiate another NAS security mode control procedure in order to provide the selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the UE as described in subclause 5.4.2.2. This second NAS security mode control procedure should be initiated as part of 5GMM common procedures of the ongoing registration procedure.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a NAS message container IE with a SERVICE REQUEST message the AMF shall complete the ongoing service request procedure by considering the SERVICE REQUEST message contained in the NAS message container IE as the message that triggered the procedure.
If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a NAS message container IE with a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message the AMF shall complete the ongoing service request procedure by considering the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message contained in the NAS message container IE as the message that triggered the procedure.

The UE shall abort the security mode control procedure and reinitiate the registration procedure.
b Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE REJECT message indication with change in the current TAI if the security mode control procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list the security mode control procedure shall be aborted and a registration procedure shall be initiated.
If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list the security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode control procedure.
c Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY MODE REJECT message indication without change in the current TAI if the security mode control procedure is triggered by a service request procedure.
The security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode control procedure.
d NAS security mode command not accepted by the UE as specified in subclause 5.4.2.5 and there is an ongoing
1 service request procedure for emergency services fallback the UE shall abort the service request procedure stop timer T3517 locally release the N1 NAS signalling connection and locally release any resources allocated for the service request procedure and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED or

If the UE finds a suitable EUTRA cell it proceeds with the appropriate EMM or 5GMM procedures. If the UE operating in singleregistration mode has changed to S1 mode it shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access.
##### 5.4.2.7	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure before the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE or SECURITY MODE REJECT message is received.
The network shall abort the security mode control procedure.
b Expiry of timer T3560.

c Collision between security mode control procedure and registration service request or deregistration procedure not indicating switch off.
The network shall abort the security mode control procedure and proceed with the UE initiated procedure.
d Collision between security mode control procedure and other 5GMM procedures than in item c.
The network shall progress both procedures.
e Lower layers indication of nondelivered NAS PDU due to handover
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 signalling connection exists the AMF shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
##### 5.4.3.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to request a particular UE to provide specific identification parameters e.g. the SUCI the IMEI the IMEISV the EUI64 or the MAC address. The SUCI is a privacy preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI and the IMEI the IMEISV the EUI64 and the MAC address are formats of PEI.
##### 5.4.3.2	Identification initiation by the network
The AMF initiates the identification procedure by sending an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE and starting timer T3570 see example in figure 5.4.3.2.1. The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested identification parameters in the Identity type information element.
Figure 5.4.3.2.1 Identification procedure
##### 5.4.3.3	Identification response by the UE
A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time whilst in 5GMMCONNECTED mode.
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message
a if the Identity type IE in the IDENTITY REQUEST message is not set to SUCI the UE shall send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message to the network. The IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain the identification parameters as requested by the network and
b if the Identity type IE in the IDENTITY REQUEST message is set to SUCI the UE shall
1 if timer T3519 is not running generate a fresh SUCI as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message with the SUCI start timer T3519 and store the value of the SUCI sent in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message and
2 if timer T3519 is running send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message with the stored SUCI.
##### 5.4.3.4	Identification completion by the network
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE the network shall stop the timer T3570.
##### 5.4.3.5	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Transmission failure of the IDENTITY RESPONSE message if the identification procedure is triggered by a registration procedure.
The UE shall reinitiate the registration procedure.
b Requested identity is not available
If the UE cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE message e.g. because no valid USIM is available then it shall encode the identity type as No identity.
##### 5.4.3.6	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure.
Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is received the network shall abort any ongoing 5GMM procedure.
b Expiry of timer T3570.
The network shall on the first expiry of the timer T3570 retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer T3570. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3570 the network shall abort the identification procedure and any ongoing 5GMM procedure.
c Collision of an identification procedure with a registration procedure for initial registration.
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicating either initial registration or emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and no registration procedure is pending on the network i.e. no REGISTRATION ACCEPTREJECT message has still to be sent as an answer to a REGISTRATION REQUEST message the network shall proceed with the registration procedure for initial registration.
d Collision of an identification procedure with a registration procedure for initial registration when the identification procedure has been caused by a registration procedure for initial registration.
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicating either initial registration or emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and a registration procedure for initial registration is pending i.e. a REGISTRATION ACCEPTREJECT message has to be sent as an answer to an earlier REGISTRATION REQUEST message then
If one or more of the information elements in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous REGISTRATION REQUEST message the network shall proceed with the new registration procedure for initial registration or
If the information elements do not differ then the network shall not treat any further this new REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
e Collision of an identification procedure with a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicating either mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating in the 5GS registration type IE before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed the network shall progress both procedures.
f Collision of an identification procedure with a UE initiated deregistration procedure.
If the network receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with switch off indication in the Deregistration type IE before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed the network shall abort the identification procedure and shall progress the UEinitiated deregistration procedure
Else the network shall complete the identification procedure and shall respond to the UEinitiated deregistration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.2.2.
##### 5.4.4.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to
a allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility managementrelated parameters decided and provided by the AMF by providing new parameter information within the command

c deliver the UAV authorization information to the UE as described in 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB or
d update the PEIPS assistance information in the UE see subclause 5.3.25.
This procedure is initiated by the network and can only be used when the UE has an established 5GMM context and the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode. When the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode the AMF may use the paging or notification procedure to initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure. The AMF can request a confirmation response in order to ensure that the parameter has been updated by the UE.
This procedure shall be initiated by the network to assign a new 5GGUTI to the UE after
a a successful service request procedure invoked as a response to a paging request from the network and before the
1 release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or
2 suspension of the N1 NAS signalling connection due to user plane CIoT 5GS optimization i.e. before the UE and the AMF enter 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication or
b the AMF receives an indication from the lower layers that it has received the NGAP UE context resume request message as specified in 3GPP TS 38.413 for a UE in 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication and this resumption is a response to a paging request from the network and before the
1 release of the N1 NAS signalling connection or
2 suspension of the N1 NAS signalling connection due to user plane CIoT 5GS optimization i.e. before the UE and the AMF enter 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication.

##### 5.4.4.2	Generic UE configuration update procedure initiated by the network
The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure by sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.
The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either
a include one or more of the following parameters 5GGUTI TAI list allowed NSSAI that may include the mapped SNSSAIs LADN information extended LADN information service area list MICO indication NITZ information configured NSSAI that may include the mapped SNSSAIs NSSRG information SNSSAI location validity information SNSSAI time validity information rejected SNSSAIs in the Rejected NSSAI IE or in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE network slicing subscription change indication operatordefined access category definitions SMS indication CAG information list UE radio capability ID 5GS registration result UE radio capability ID deletion indication truncated 5GSTMSI configuration T3447 value list of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition disaster roaming wait range disaster return wait range PEIPS assistance information the priority indicator the NSAG information alternative NSSAI partially allowed NSSAI partially rejected NSSAI ondemand NSSAI feature authorization indication discontinuous coverage maximum time offset or RAT utilization control information
b include the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration requested bit set to registration requested or
c include a combination of both a and b.
If the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN the serving SNPN shall not provide the configured NSSAI the allowed NSSAI or the rejected NSSAI to the UE.
If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE. Otherwise the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Rejected NSSAI IE.
In roaming scenarios if the Extended rejected NSSAI IE is included in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the AMF shall provide mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI.
If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested the AMF shall indicate acknowledgement requested in the Acknowledgement bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and shall start timer T3555. Acknowledgement shall be requested for all parameters except when only NITZ information is included.
To initiate parameter renegotiation between the UE and network the AMF shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
NOTE 1 Generic UE configuration update procedure can be initiated by the AMF for updating the emergency number list the extended emergency number list or both by indicating registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.
If a new allowed NSSAI information or AMF reconfiguration of supported SNSSAIs requires an AMF relocation the AMF shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE and include the Allowed NSSAI IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the AMF includes a new allowed NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the subscription information includes the NSSRG information then the SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value. If the network has pending NSSAI the SNSSAIs in the pending NSSAI and allowed NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value.
If the AMF includes a new partially allowed NSSAI and the new partially allowed NSSAI requires an AMF relocation the AMF shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE and include the Partially allowed NSSAI IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the AMF includes a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the new configured NSSAI requires an AMF relocation as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 the AMF shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the message.
If the AMF includes a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the subscription information includes the NSSRG information and the UE has set the NSSRG bit in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to
a NSSRG supported then the AMF shall include the NSSRG information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message or
b NSSRG not supported then the configured NSSAI shall include one or more SNSSAIs each of which is associated with all the NSSRG values of the default SNSSAIs or the configured NSSAI shall include based on the indication received from the UDM as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 all subscribed SNSSAIs even if these SNSSAIs do not share any common NSSRG value.
If the AMF needs to update the NSSRG information and the UE has set the NSSRG bit to NSSRG supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message then the AMF shall include the new NSSRG information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the AMF includes a new NSSRG information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the AMF determines that the UE needs to provide a new requested NSSAI due to no NSSRG value common to all the SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI based on the new NSSRG information then the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE.
If the UE supports SNSSAI time validity information and the AMF needs to update the SNSSAI time validity information then the AMF shall include the new SNSSAI time validity information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the AMF needs to update the SNSSAI location validity information toward a UE which has set the SLVI bit to SNSSAI location validity information supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message then the AMF shall include the new SNSSAI location validity information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is initiated only due to changes to the allowed NSSAI and these changes require the UE to initiate a registration procedure but the AMF is unable to determine an allowed NSSAI for the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 then the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message shall indicate registration requested in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE and shall not contain any other parameters.
If the slice deregistration inactivity timer has expired the UE does not support network slice usage control and the AMF removes the ondemand SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI over the corresponding access type the AMF shall include the new allowed NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If
the AMF needs to enforce a change in the restriction on the use of enhanced coverage or use of CE mode B as described in subclause 5.3.18
the AMF decides to inform a UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode and registered for disaster roaming services that a disaster condition is no longer applicable or
the AMF needs to redirect the UE to EPC as described in subclause 4.8.4A.2
NOTE 1A The case of the AMF triggering a generic UE configuration update procedure to inform a UE registered for disaster roaming services that a disaster condition is no longer applicable is only applicable for a UE already in 5GMMCONNECTED mode.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list it is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the generic UE configuration update procedure.
b Transmission failure of CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE message indication without TAI change from lower layers
It is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the generic UE configuration update procedure.
c Generic UE configuration update and deregistration procedure collision

This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3555 the procedure shall be aborted. In addition if the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes the 5GGUTI IE the network shall behave as described in case b1 below.
b Lower layer failure.
If a lower layer failure is detected before the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE message is received and
1 if the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes the 5GGUTI IE the old and the new 5GGUTI shall be considered as valid until the old 5GGUTI can be considered as invalid by the AMF. If a new TAI list was provided in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the old and new TAI list shall also be considered as valid until the old TAI list can be considered as invalid by the AMF.
Additionally if the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes a new Paging subgroup ID and the UE is previously assigned a different Paging subgroup ID then the AMF shall consider both the old and new Paging subgroup IDs as valid until the old Paging subgroup ID can be considered as invalid by the AMF.
During this period the AMF
i may first use the old 5GSTMSI from the old 5GGUTI and the old Paging subgroup ID if any for paging within the area defined by the old TAI list for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts for network originated transactions. If a new TAI list was provided in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the new TAI list should also be used for paging. Upon response from the UE the AMF may reinitiate the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND. If the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes a new Paging subgroup ID then the AMF may reinitiate the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND. If the response is received from a tracking area within the old and new TAI list the network shall reinitiate the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. If no response is received to the paging attempts the network may use the new 5GSTMSI from the new 5GGUTI and the new Paging subgroup ID if any for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts. In this case if a new TAI list was provided with new 5GGUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message the new TAI list shall be used instead of the old TAI list. Upon response from the UE the AMF shall consider the new 5GGUTI and the new PEIPS assistance information as valid and the old 5GGUTI and the old PEIPS assistance information as invalid.
ii shall consider the new 5GGUTI as valid if it is used by the UE and additionally the new TAI list as valid if it was provided with this 5GGUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and
iii may use the identification procedure followed by a new generic UE configuration update procedure if the UE uses the old 5GGUTI or
2 if the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message does not include the 5GGUTI IE and
i the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message does not contain the Allowed NSSAI IE the Rejected NSSAI IE the Extended rejected NSSAI IE or the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE the network shall abort the procedure or
ii the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message contains the Allowed NSSAI IE the Rejected NSSAI IE the Extended rejected NSSAI IE or the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE the network shall either abort the procedure or retransmit the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message on expiry of the timer T3555. The retransmission shall not be repeated more than four times. If the retransmission is repeated for four times the network shall abort the procedure.
c Generic UE configuration update and UE initiated deregistration procedure collision.
If the network receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing generic UE configuration update procedure has been completed the network shall abort the generic UE configuration update procedure and shall progress the deregistration procedure.
d Generic UE configuration update and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update collision
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing generic UE configuration update procedure has been completed the network shall abort the generic UE configuration update procedure and shall progress the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update procedure.
e Generic UE configuration update and service request procedure collision
If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing generic UE configuration update procedure has been completed and the SERVICE REQUEST message does not include UE request type IE with Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release both the procedures shall be progressed.
If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing generic UE configuration update procedure has been completed and the SERVICE REQUEST message includes UE request type IE with Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release the network shall abort the generic UE configuration update procedure and shall progress the service request procedure.

###### 5.4.5.2.3	UE-initiated NAS transport of messages accepted by the network
Upon reception of a UL NAS TRANSPORT message if the Payload container type IE is set to
a N1 SM information the AMF looks up a PDU session routing context for
1 the UE and the PDU session ID IE in case the Old PDU session ID IE is not included and
NOTE 1 If the Old PDU session ID IE is not included in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message and the AMF has received a reallocation requested indication from the SMF the AMF needs to ignore the reallocation requested indication.
i if the AMF has a PDU session routing context for the PDU session ID and the UE and the Request type IE is either not included or is included but set to other value than initial request existing PDU session initial emergency request existing emergency PDU session or MA PDU request the AMF shall send the 5GSM message and the PDU session ID IE towards the SMF identified by the SMF ID of the PDU session routing context

If the SNSSAI IE is not included the UE does not have a partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI contains
one SNSSAI the AMF shall use the SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI as the SNSSAI. Additionally for a UE for which the AMF has provided a NSAoS the AMF shall use the SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI if the UE is inside the NSAoS with respect to the SNSSAI
two or more SNSSAIs and the users subscription context obtained from UDM contains only one default SNSSAI that is included in the allowed NSSAI the AMF shall use the SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI that matches the default SNSSAI as the SNSSAI or
two or more SNSSAIs and the users subscription context obtained from UDM contains two or more default SNSSAIs included in the allowed NSSAI the AMF shall use an SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI selected based on operator policy as the SNSSAI.
If SNSSAI IE is not included the UE has both a partially allowed NSSAI and an allowed NSSAI the AMF shall select an SNSSAI from the partially allowed NSSAI or the allowed NSSAI based on operator policy. Additionally
for the case when the AMF determines to use the allowed NSSAI for selecting an SNSSAI and for a UE for which the AMF has provided a NSAoS the AMF shall use the SNSSAI in the allowed NSSAI if the UE is inside the NSAoS with respect to the SNSSAI or

###### 5.4.5.3.2	Network-initiated NAS transport procedure initiation
In 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF initiates the NAS transport procedure by sending the DL NAS TRANSPORT message as shown in figure 5.4.5.3.2.1.
In case a in subclause 5.4.5.3.1 i.e. upon reception from an SMF of a 5GSM message without an N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication for a UE or a 5GSM message with an N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication for a UE in the 5GMMCONNECTED mode the AMF shall
a include the PDU session information PDU session ID in the PDU session ID IE
b set the Payload container type IE to N1 SM information and
c set the Payload container IE to the 5GSM message.
In case b in subclause 5.4.5.3.1 i.e. upon reception from an SMSF of an SMS payload the AMF shall
a set the Payload container type IE to SMS
b set the Payload container IE to the SMS payload and
c select the access type to deliver the DL NAS TRANSPORT message as follows in case the access type selection is required
1 if the UE to receive the DL NAS TRANSPORT message is registered to the network via both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the 5GMM context of the UE indicates that SMS over NAS is allowed the UE is in MICO mode and the UE is in 5GMMIDLE mode for 3GPP access and in 5GMMCONNECTED mode for non3GPP access then the AMF selects non3GPP access. Otherwise the AMF selects either 3GPP access or non3GPP access.
If the delivery of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message over 3GPP access has failed the AMF may resend the DL NAS TRANSPORT message over the non3GPP access.
If the delivery of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message over non3GPP access has failed the AMF may resend the DL NAS TRANSPORT message over the 3GPP access and
2 otherwise the AMF selects 3GPP access.
NOTE 1 The AMF selects an access type between 3GPP access and non3GPP access based on operator policy.
In case c in subclause 5.4.5.3.1 i.e. upon reception from an LMF of an LPP message payload the AMF shall
a set the Payload container type IE to LTE Positioning Protocol LPP message container
b set the Payload container IE to the LPP message payload received from the LMF
c set the Additional information IE to an LCS correlation identifier received from the LMF from which the LPP message was received.
NOTE 2 The LCS correlation identifier is assigned originally by the AMF except for LPP message transfer associated with event reporting for periodic or triggered location as described in subclause 6.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.273 6B where the LMF assigns the LCS correlation identifier. AMF and LMF assigned LCS correlation identifiers can be distinguished by an implementation specific convention e.g. use of a different number of octets to enable an AMF to distinguish one from the other when received in the Additional Information IE in an UL NAS Transport message.

c set the Payload container IE to the 5GSM message which was not forwarded
d set the 5GMM cause IE to the 5GMM cause #90 payload was not forwarded or 5GMM cause #91 DNN not supported or not subscribed in the slice.
The AMF sets the 5GMM cause IE to the 5GMM cause #91 DNN not supported or not subscribed in the slice if the 5GSM message could not be forwarded since SMF selection fails because
1 the DNN is not supported in the slice identified by the SNSSAI used by the AMF or
2 neither the DNN provided by the UE nor the wildcard DNN are in the subscribed DNN list of the UE for the SNSSAI used by the AMF.
Otherwise the AMF sets the 5GMM cause IE to the 5GMM cause #90 payload was not forwarded and
e optionally include the Backoff timer value IE if the 5GMM cause IE is set to 5GMM cause #91 DNN not supported or not subscribed in the slice due to the DNN is not supported in the slice.

##### 5.4.6.1	General
The purpose of the 5GMM status procedure is to report at any time in the 5GMM STATUS message certain error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol data in the AMF or in the UE. The 5GMM STATUS message can be sent by both the AMF and the UE see example in figure 5.4.6.1.
Figure 5.4.6.1 5GMM status procedure
##### 5.4.6.2	5GMM status received in the UE
On receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface i.e. local actions are possible. The local actions to be taken by UE on receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message are implementation dependent.
##### 5.4.6.3	5GMM status received in the network
On receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message in the AMF no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface i.e. local actions are possible. The local actions to be taken by the AMF on receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message are implementation dependent.
##### 5.4.7.1	General
The purpose of the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is to enable the authentication authorization and accounting server AAAS via the Network Slice Specific and SNPN Authentication and Authorization Function NSSAAF to reauthenticate or reauthorize the upper layers of the UE.
The network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure can be invoked for a UE supporting network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and for a HPLMN SNSSAI or an SNPN SNSSAI see subclauses 5.15.10 and 5.30.2.9 in 3GPP TS 23.501 and subclause 4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 .
The network reauthenticates the UE using the EAP as specified in IETF RFC 3748 .
EAP has defined four types of EAP messages
a an EAPrequest message
b an EAPresponse message
c an EAPsuccess message and
d an EAPfailure message.
The EAPrequest message is transported from the network to the UE using the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message of the network slicespecific EAP message reliable transport procedure.
The EAPresponse message to the EAPrequest message is transported from the UE to the network using the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message of the network slicespecific EAP message reliable transport procedure.
If the reauthentication of the UE completes successfully or unsuccessfully the EAPsuccess message or the EAPfailure message respectively is transported from the network to the UE using the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the network slicespecific result message transport procedure.
There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAPrequest message and a related EAPresponse message for the AAAS via the NSSAAF to complete the reauthentication and reauthorization of the request for an SNSSAI see example in figure 5.4.7.1.1.
The AMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in subclause 4.3 of IETF RFC 3748 to infinite value.
NOTE The network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure provides a reliable transport of EAP messages and therefore retransmissions at the EAP layer of the AMF do not occur.
Figure 5.4.7.1.1 Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure
###### 5.4.7.2.1	Network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation
In order to initiate the network slicespecific EAP message reliable transport procedure the AMF shall create a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message.
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the EAPrequest message which is generated by the AMF or provided by the AAAS via the NSSAAF.
The AMF shall set the SNSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI to which the EAPrequest message is related.
The AMF shall send the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and start timer T3575 per SNSSAI see example in figure 5.4.7.1.1.
Upon receipt of a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message the UE shall stop timer T3346 if running. The UE shall pass
a the EAPrequest message received in the EAP message IE and
b the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI in the SNSSAI IE
to the upper layers. Apart from this action the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE.
###### 5.4.7.2.2	Network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure accepted by the UE
When the upper layers provide an EAPresponse message associated with the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI the UE shall create a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message.
The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the EAPresponse message.
The UE shall set the SNSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI associated with the EAPresponse message.
The UE shall send the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message. Apart from this action the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE.
Upon receipt of a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message the AMF shall stop timer T3575 and
a pass the EAPresponse message received in the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message associated with the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI in the SNSSAI IE to the upper layers or
b provide the EAPresponse message received in the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message associated with the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI in the SNSSAI IE to the AAAS via the NSSAAF.
###### 5.4.7.2.3	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a T3575 expiry
The AMF shall on the first expiry of the timer T3575 retransmit the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T3575. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3575 the AMF shall abort the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure for the SNSSAI. The AMF shall consider that the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure for the SNSSAI is completed as a failure.
b Lower layers indication of nondelivered NAS PDU due to handover
If the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TAI is included in the TAI list then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message. If a failure of handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists the AMF shall retransmit the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message.
c Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and deregistration procedure collision
If the network receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is the same as the one for which the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing the network shall abort the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and shall progress the UEinitiated deregistration procedure. The AMF may initiate the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure for the SNSSAI which is completed as a failure if available. If the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is different from the one for which the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing the network shall proceed with both procedures.
d Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and service request procedure collision
If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message or a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release the network shall abort the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and shall progress the service request procedure.
If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message or a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message does not include UE request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release both procedures shall be progressed.
e Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update collision
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the Unavailability information IE without start of the unavailability period or the request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release the network shall abort the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and shall progress the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update procedure.
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes neither the Unavailability information IE nor the request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release both procedures shall be progressed.
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message before the ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the Unavailability information IE with the start of the unavailability period both the procedures shall be progressed.
###### 5.4.7.2.4	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Transmission failure of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message with change in the current TAI
If the current TAI is not in the TAI list the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure shall be aborted and
1 if the UE is in 5GMMREGISTERED state a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update indicating mobility registration updating in the 5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall be initiated and
otherwise a registration procedure for initial registration shall be initiated.
b Transmission failure of NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message indication without change in the current TAI
It is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure.
c Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and deregistration procedure collision
If the UE receives NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message after sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is the same as the access in which the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message is received then the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the deregistration procedure. Otherwise the UE shall proceed with both procedures.
d Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and service request procedure collision
If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release and the UE receives a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message before the ongoing service request procedure has been completed the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the service request procedure.
If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message does not include the UE request type IE with the Request type value set to NAS signalling connection release and the UE receives a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message before the ongoing service request procedure has been completed the UE shall proceed with both procedures.
e Network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update collision
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the Unavailability information IE without start of the unavailability period and the UE receives a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message before the ongoing registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update has been completed the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update procedure.

###### 5.4.7.3.1	Network slice-specific EAP result message transport procedure initiation
In order to initiate the network slicespecific EAP result message transport procedure the AMF shall create a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message.
The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to the EAPsuccess or EAPfailure message provided by the AAAS via the NSSAAF.
The AMF shall set the SNSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI to which the EAPsuccess or EAPfailure message is related.
The AMF shall send the NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message. The AMF shall retain the authentication result for the UE and the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI while the UE is registered to the PLMN see subclause 5.15.10 in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
Upon receipt of a NETWORK SLICESPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message the UE shall pass
a the EAPsuccess or EAPfailure message received in the EAP message IE and
b the HPLMN SNSSAI or the SNPN SNSSAI in the SNSSAI IE
to the upper layers. Apart from this action the network slicespecific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE.
##### 5.5.1.1	General
The registration procedure is always initiated by the UE and used for initial registration as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.2 or mobility and periodic registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2.
When the UE needs to initiate registration over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access in the same PLMN e.g. the 3GPP access and the selected N3IWF are located in the same PLMN the UE
a in 5GMMREGISTEREDINITIATED over 3GPP access shall not initiate registration over non3GPP access or
b in 5GMMREGISTEREDINITIATED over non3GPP access shall not initiate registration over 3GPP access.
NOTE 1 To which access i.e. 3GPP access or non3GPP access the UE initiates registration first is up to UE implementation.
When the UE is registered with a PLMN over a non3GPP access the AMF and the UE maintain
a registration state and state machine over non3GPP access
b 5G NAS security context
c 5GGUTI
d registration area for non3GPP access which is associated with a single TAI and
e non3GPP deregistration timer in the UE and non3GPP implicit deregistration timer in the AMF.
A registration attempt counter is used to limit the number of subsequently rejected registration attempts. The registration attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7 or subclause 5.5.1.3.7. Depending on the value of the registration attempt counter specific actions shall be performed. The registration attempt counter shall be reset when
the UE is powered on
a USIM is inserted
a registration procedure is successfully completed
an EPS attach combined EPS attach procedure a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking area updating procedure is successfully completed in S1 mode and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode. In this case the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access
NOTE 2 The registration attempt counter for non3GPP access is not impacted by the EPS attach and the combined EPS attach procedure.
a registration procedure is rejected with cause #11 #12 #13 #15 #27 #31 #62 #72 #73 #74 #75 #76 #77 or #78
a registration procedure is rejected with cause #3 #6 or #7 the REGISTRATION REJECT message is received without integrity protection and the counter for SIMUSIM considered invalid for GPRS services events has a value less than a UE implementationspecific maximum value.
a network initiated deregistration procedure is completed with cause #11 #12 #13 #15 #27 #62 #72 #74 #75 #76 #77 or #78 or
a new PLMN or SNPN is selected.
Additionally the registration attempt counter shall be reset when the UE is in substate 5GMMDEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATION or 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE and
the current TAI is changed
timer T3502 expires or
timer T3346 is started.
When the registration attempt counter is reset the UE shall stop timer T3519 if running and delete any stored SUCI.
The lower layers indicate to NAS whether the network supports emergency services for the UE in limited service state see 3GPP TS 38.331 . This information is taken into account when deciding whether to initiate an initial registration for emergency services.
###### 5.5.1.2.1	General
This procedure can be used by a UE for initial registration for 5GS services.
When the UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration the UE shall indicate initial registration in the 5GS registration type IE. When the UE initiates the registration procedure for emergency services the UE shall indicate emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE. When the UE initiates the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall indicate SNPN onboarding registration in the 5GS registration type IE. When the UE initiates the initial registration procedure for disaster roaming services the UE shall indicate disaster roaming initial registration in the 5GS registration type IE.
If the MUSIM UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration and indicates emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the network shall not indicate the support of
a the N1 NAS signalling connection release
b the paging indication for voice services
c the reject paging request or
d the paging restriction
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
###### 5.5.1.2.2	Initial registration initiation
The UE in state 5GMMDEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF
a when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services
b when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services
c when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS
d when the UE moves from GERAN to NGRAN coverage or the UE moves from a UTRAN to NGRAN coverage and the following applies
1 the UE initiated a GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure while in AGb mode or Iu mode or
2 the UE has performed 5GSRVCC from NGRAN to UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 6A
and since then the UE did not perform a successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in S1 mode or registration procedure in N1 mode
e when the UE performs initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN
f when the UE performs initial registration for disaster roaming services and
g when the UE performs initial registration to come out of unavailability period and resume normal services
with the following clarifications to initial registration for emergency services
a the UE shall not initiate an initial registration for emergency services over the current access if the UE is already registered for emergency services over the noncurrent access unless the initial registration has to be initiated to perform handover of an existing emergency PDU session from the noncurrent access to the current access and
NOTE 1 Transfer of an existing emergency PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access is needed e.g. if the UE determines that the current access is no longer available.
b the UE can only initiate an initial registration for emergency services over non3GPP access if it cannot register for emergency services over 3GPP access.
The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF starting timer T3510. If timer T3502 is currently running the UE shall stop timer T3502. If timer T3511 is currently running the UE shall stop timer T3511.

b in the partially rejected NSSAI and the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is rejected. If the UE is inside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI in the partially rejected NSSAI and the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is rejected the SNSSAI may be included in the requested NSSAI.
In addition if the NSSRG information is available the subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value. The UE may also include in the requested NSSAI the SNSSAIs which were added to configured NSSAI in S1 mode and for which the associated NSSRG information is not available. If the UE is in 5GMMREGISTERED state over the other access and has already an allowed NSSAI for the other access in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs all the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI for the current access shall share at least an NSSRG value common to all the SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI for the other access. If the UE is simultaneously performing the registration procedure on the other access in different PLMNs the UE shall include SNSSAIs that share at least a common NSSRG value across all access types. If the UE has pending NSSAI which the UE is still interested in using then SNSSAIs in the pending NSSAI and requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value.
NOTE 6 If the UE has stored mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI and one or more SNSSAIs in the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are not included in the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI then a SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI associated to one or more of these mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are available to be included in the requested NSSAI together with their mapped SNSSAI.

NOTE 8 There is no need to consider the case that the UE is simultaneously performing the registration procedure on the other access in the same PLMN due to that the UE is not allowed to initiate the registration procedure over one access when the registration over the other access to the same PLMN is going on.
The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or more SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.
NOTE 9 How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific. The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers e.g. policies like URSP applications and UE local configuration into account.

Figure 5.5.1.2.2.1 Registration procedure for initial registration
###### 5.5.1.2.3	5GMM common procedure initiation
The network may initiate 5GMM common procedures e.g. the identification authentication and security procedures during the registration procedure depending on the information received in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If two NAS security mode control procedures are needed to signal an entire unciphered REGISTRATION REQUEST message followed by signalling of selected EPS NAS security algorithms both NAS security mode control procedures should be initiated as part of 5GMM common procedures of the ongoing registration procedure see subclause 5.4.2.4.
During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration if the AMF is configured to support emergency registration for unauthenticated SUCIs the AMF may choose to skip the authentication procedure even if no 5G NAS security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure.
###### 5.5.1.2.4	Initial registration accepted by the network
During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to emergency registration the AMF shall not check for mobility and access restrictions regional restrictions or subscription restrictions or CAG restrictions when processing the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the initial registration request is accepted by the network the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE.
NOTE 0 If the AMF receives the initial registration request over non3GPP access and detects that the N3IWF used by the UE is compatible with only part of the allowed NSSAI and the UE has not indicated its support for slicebased N3IWF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF accepts the initial registration request.
NOTE 0A If the AMF receives the initial registration request over non3GPP access and detects that the TNGF used by the UE is compatible with only part of the allowed NSSAI and the UE has not indicated its support for slicebased TNGF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF accepts the initial registration request.
For each of the information elements 5GMM capability S1 UE network capability and UE security capability the AMF shall store all octets received from the UE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message up to the maximum length defined for the respective information element.
NOTE 1 This information is forwarded to the new AMF during interAMF handover or to the new MME during intersystem handover to S1 mode.
The AMF shall assign and include a TAI list as a registration area the UE is registered to in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF shall not assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NBN1 mode and tracking areas not in NBN1 mode. The UE upon receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall delete its old TAI list and store the received TAI list. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was received over non3GPP access the AMF shall include a single TAI in the TAI list.
NOTE 2 For non3GPP access the operator can allocate a TAI per N3IWF TNGF TWIF or WAGF. Each N3IWF TNGF TWIF or WAGF is locally configured with a TAI. Each N3IWF TNGF TWIF or WAGF can be configured with its own TAI value or with the same TAI value as other N3IWFs TNGFs TWIFs or WAGFs.
NOTE 3 When assigning the TAI list the AMF can take into account the eNodeBs capability of support of CIoT 5GS optimization.
The AMF may include service area restrictions in the Service area list IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE upon receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the service area restrictions shall act as described in subclause 5.3.5.
The AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code MCC+MNC. The UE shall store the list as provided by the network and if the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the forbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause 5.3.13A. In addition the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list then the UE shall delete the stored list. The AMF of a PLMN shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs.
If the ESI bit of the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is set to equivalent SNPNs supported the AMF of a SNPN may include a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the initial registration request is for onboarding services in SNPN the AMF shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains an SNPN identity. The UE shall store the list as provided by the network. If the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services and is not the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall remove from the list any SNPN identity that is already in
the permanently forbidden SNPNs list or the temporarily forbidden SNPNs list if the SNPN is not an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 or
the permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list or the temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN list if the SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 .
The UE shall add to the stored list the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list then the UE shall delete the stored list. The AMF of an SNPN shall not include a list of equivalent PLMNs.
NOTE 3A If N1 mode was disabled for an SNPN due to reception of 5GMM cause #27 or #62 the UE implementation ensures that it does not register to this SNPN due to being part of the list of equivalent SNPNs received while registered in another SNPN.
If the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services the UE is not registered for disaster roaming services and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the forbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause 5.3.13A any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding lists.
If the Service area list IE is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message any tracking area in the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs in the registration area or in the registered SNPN is considered as an allowed tracking area as described in subclause 5.3.5.

If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the 5GS registration type IE set to SNPN onboarding registration or the network determines that the UEs subscription only allows for configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane the AMF may start an implementation specific timer for onboarding services when the network considers that the UE is in 5GMMREGISTERED i.e. the network receives the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message from UE.
NOTE 21 If the AMF considers that the UE is in 5GMMIDLE when the implementation specific timer for onboarding services expires and the network considers that the UE is still in state 5GMMREGISTERED the AMF can locally deregister the UE or if the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED the AMF can initiate the networkinitiated deregistration procedure see subclause 5.5.2.3.
NOTE 22 The value of the implementation specific timer for onboarding services needs to be large enough to allow a UE to complete the configuration of one or more entries of the list of subscriber data taking into consideration that configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane or onboarding services in SNPN involves third party entities outside of the operators network.
If the UE receives the List of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the UE supports MINT the UE shall delete the list of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition stored in the ME together with the PLMN ID of the RPLMN if any and may store the list of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition included in the List of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition IE in the ME together with the PLMN ID of the RPLMN.

If the AMF determines that a disaster condition applies to the PLMN with disaster condition and the UE is allowed to be registered for disaster roaming services the AMF shall set the Disaster roaming registration result value bit in the 5GS registration result IE to no additional information in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the AMF determines that the UE can be registered to the PLMN for normal service the AMF shall set the Disaster roaming registration result value bit in the 5GS registration result IE to request for registration for disaster roaming services accepted as registration not for disaster roaming services in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
If the UE indicates disaster roaming initial registration in the 5GS registration type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the 5GS registration result IE value in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is set to
a request for registration for disaster roaming service accepted as registration not for disaster roaming service the UE shall consider itself registered for normal service. If the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the forbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause 5.3.13A any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding lists. If UE supports S1 mode the UE shall initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and indicate that S1 mode is supported as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 or

If the UE receives the forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall store the TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE if not already stored into the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming.
If the UE receives the forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall store the TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE if not already stored into the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service.
If the UE supporting the reconnection to the network due to RAN timing synchronization status change receives the RAN timing synchronization IE with the RecReq bit set to Reconnection requested in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall operate as specified in subclauses 5.3.1.4 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.1.
If the UE supports discontinuous coverage and is registered over a satellite NGRAN access the AMF may for discontinuous coverage include the Discontinuous coverage maximum time offset IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
If the UE receives the Discontinuous coverage maximum time offset IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall replace any previously received discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value on the same satellite NGRAN RAT type and PLMN with the latest received timer value.
If the UE receives the Unavailability configuration IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE shall consider that the corresponding unavailability type is unavailability due to discontinuous coverage. A UE that does not implement this unavailability type may ignore the Unavailability configuration IE provided by the AMF. If the EUPR bit is set to UE does not need to report end of unavailability period the UE is not required to initiate the registration procedure for mobility registration update when the unavailability period duration has ended.
If the UE receives the Unavailability configuration IE with a value of the unavailability period duration in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT then the UE may either
a delete a UE determined value and start using the received unavailability period duration value or
b use a UE determined value.If the UE receives the Unavailability configuration IE with a value of the start of the unavailability period in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message then the UE may either
a delete a UE determined value and start using the received start of the unavailability period value or
b use a UE determined value.
NOTE 24 The UE can consider the received value from the network when determining the value for unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period.
If the UE operating as MBSR receives the MBSRAI field of the Feature authorization indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers of the status of MBSR authorization as specified in subclause 5.35A.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 .

Otherwise if the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain the RAT utilization control IE the UE shall delete the stored RAT utilization control information associated with the current PLMN if any.
###### 5.5.1.2.5	Initial registration not accepted by the network
If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.
If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control for an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN the network may set an appropriate cause value other than 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and does not assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
In NBN1 mode if the registration request is rejected due to operator determined barring see 3GPP TS 29.503 20AB the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #76 or #78 was received without integrity protection then the UE shall discard the message. If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #62 was received without integrity protected the behaviour of the UE is specified in subclause 5.3.20.2.
Based on operator policy if the initial registration request is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #31 Redirection to EPC required.
NOTE 1 The network can take into account the UEs S1 mode capability the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the EPC to determine the rejection with the 5GMM cause value #31 Redirection to EPC required.
If the initial registration request is rejected because
a all the SNSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI are rejected and
b the UE set the NSSAA bit in the 5GMM capability IE to
1 Network slicespecific authentication and authorization supported and
i void
ii all default SNSSAIs are not allowed or
iii network slicespecific authentication and authorization has failed or been revoked for all default SNSSAIs and based on network local policy the network decides not to initiate the network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedures for any default SNSSAI requested by the UE or
2 Network slicespecific authentication and authorization not supported and all default SNSSAIs are either not allowed or are subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization
i void
ii void
the network shall set the 5GMM cause value of the REGISTRATION REJECT message to #62 No network slices available.
If the 5GMM cause value is set to #62 No network slices available the network shall include in the rejected NSSAI of the REGISTRATION REJECT message all the SNSSAIs which were included in the requested NSSAI.
If the UE has set the ERNSSAI bit to Extended rejected NSSAI supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message. Otherwise the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
In roaming scenarios if the Extended rejected NSSAI IE is included in the REGISTRATION REJECT message the AMF shall provide mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI.
If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the AMF determines that maximum number of UEs reached for one or more SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5 the AMF shall include the rejected NSSAI containing one or more SNSSAIs with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message. In addition the AMF may include a backoff timer value for each SNSSAI with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
If the AMF receives the initial registration request along with the authenticated indication over N2 reference point on non3GPP access and does not receive the indication that authentication by the home network is not required over N12 reference point or the 5GRG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device is not allowed to access 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 6D the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #72 Non3GPP access to 5GCN not allowed.
If the initial registration request from a UE supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only and should include the CAG information list in the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
NOTE 2 The network cannot be certain that CAG information list stored in the UE is updated as result of sending of the REGISTRATION REJECT message with the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE as the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not necessarily delivered to the UE e.g. due to abnormal radio conditions.
NOTE 3 The CAG information list can be provided by the AMF and include no entry if no CAG information list exists in the subscription.
NOTE 4 If the UE supports extended CAG information list the CAG information list can be included either in the CAG information list IE or Extended CAG information list IE.
NOTE 4A It is unexpected for network to send REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE with 5GMM cause value #76 in nonCAG cell and not indicate Indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the serving PLMN in the Extended CAG information list or the CAG information list.
If the UE does not support extended CAG information list the CAG information list shall not be included in the Extended CAG information list IE.
If the initial registration request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall operate as described in bullet j of subclause 5.5.1.2.8.
If the UEs initial registration request is via a satellite NGRAN cell and the network using the User Location Information provided by the NGRAN see 3GPP TS 38.413 is able to determine that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the REGISTRATION REJECT message to #78 PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location.
NOTE 5 When the UE is accessing network for emergency services it is up to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to operate.
NOTE 5A While location determination is ongoing to ensure that operator and regulatory policies are met the AMF can perform DNNbased or SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclauses 5.3.10 and 5.3.11 to prevent the UE from accessing network.
If the AMF receives the initial registration request including the servicelevel device ID set to the CAAlevel UAV ID in the ServicelevelAA container IE and the AMF determines that the UE is not allowed to use UAS services via 5GS based on the users subscription data and the operator policy the AMF shall return a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #79 “UAS services not allowed”.
If the UE initiates the registration procedure for disaster roaming services and the AMF determines that it does not support providing disaster roaming services for the determined PLMN with disaster condition to the UE then the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #80 “Disaster roaming for the determined PLMN with disaster condition not allowed”.
If the AMF receives the initial registration request over non3GPP access and detects that the N3IWF used by the UE is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and the UE has indicated its support for slicebased N3IWF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF may send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #81 “Selected N3IWF is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI” and may provide information for a suitable N3IWF in the REGISTRATION REJECT message indicating the suitable N3IWF that is compatible with the requested NSSAI.
If the AMF receives the initial registration request over non3GPP access and detects that the TNGF used by the UE is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and the UE has indicated its support for slicebased TNGF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF may send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #82 “Selected TNGF is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI” and may provide information for a suitable TNAN in the TNAN information IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message indicating the suitable TNGF that is compatible with the requested NSSAI.
If the AMF received multiple TAIs from the satellite NGRAN as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 and determines that by UE subscription and operators preferences all of the received TAIs are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service the AMF shall include the TAIs in
a the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE or
b the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE or
c both
in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
Regardless of the 5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message via satellite NGRAN
if the UE receives the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message the UE shall store the TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE if not already stored into the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming and
if the UE receives the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message the UE shall store the TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE if not already stored into the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service.
If
a the UE indicates support of the RAT utilization control in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message over 3GPP access
b the network decides to apply the RAT utilization control based on the operator policy and
c the secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is established between the UE and the AMF
the AMF shall send the integrity protected REGISTRATION REJECT message with the 5GMM cause value set to #15 No suitable cells in tracking area and include the RAT utilization control IE. In the RAT utilization control IE the AMF shall indicate that the access technology of the NGRAN cell on which the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was received is restricted.
NOTE 5B Other restricted access technologies can be indicated in the RAT utilization control IE if any.
Furthermore the UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
#6	(Illegal ME).

2 set the counter for the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid for 3GPP access events and the counter for the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid for non3GPP access events in case of SNPN if the UE maintains these counters
to a UE implementationspecific maximum value.
If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode the UE shall handle the EMM parameters EMM state EPS update status 4GGUTI last visited registered TAI TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 for the case when the EPS attach request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for nonEPS services until switching off the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in subclause 5.3.7a in 3GPP TS 24.301 . If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for SIMUSIM considered invalid for nonGPRS services then the UE shall set this counter to a UE implementationspecific maximum value.
If the UE is performing initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter store the SNPN identity in the permanently forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN list enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH and perform an SNPN selection or an SNPN selection for onboarding services according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .

1 the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN
2 the UE needs to perform the registration procedure for initial registration for emergency services
3 the UE receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with the reregistration required indication
4 the UE in NBN1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and
the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 and
timer T3346 was not started when N1 NAS signalling connection was established with RRC establishment cause set to moExceptionData or
5 the UE needs to perform the registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration for initiating of an emergency PDU session upon request of the upper layers to establish the emergency PDU session.
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.
NOTE 1 It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a registration procedure for initial registration while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a nonsuccessful case.
b The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred.
The UE shall not start the initial registration procedure. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Receipt of the access barred indication shall not trigger the selection of a different core network type EPC or 5GCN.
The initial registration procedure is started if still needed when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated.
ba The lower layers indicate that
1 access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0 and 2 or
2 access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0.
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has not been sent the UE shall proceed as specified for case b. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent the UE shall proceed as specified for case e and additionally the registration procedure for initial registration is started if still needed when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated.
c T3510 timeout.
The UE shall abort the registration procedure for initial registration and the NAS signalling connection if any shall be released locally if the initial registration request is neither for emergency services nor for initiating a PDU session for emergency services with request type set to existing emergency PDU session.

If the current TAI is changed before the registration procedure for initial registration is completed the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and reinitiated immediately.
If the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message needs to be sent and a tracking area border is crossed when the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message has been received but before a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is sent and
1 if the current TAI is in the TAI list the UE sends the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the network and
2 otherwise the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and the registration procedure for mobility registration update shall be initiated.
If a 5GGUTI was allocated during the registration procedure this 5GGUTI shall be used in the registration procedure.
i Transmission failure of REGISTRATION COMPLETE message indication with change in the current TAI.
1 If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list the UE resends the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the network and
2 otherwise the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and the registration procedure for mobility registration update shall be initiated.
j Transmission failure of REGISTRATION COMPLETE message indication without change in the current TAI from lower layers.
It is up to the UE implementation how to rerun the ongoing procedure.
k Transmission failure of REGISTRATION REQUEST message indication from the lower layers.
The registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and reinitiated immediately.
l Timer T3447 is running.
The UE shall not start the registration procedure for initial registration with Followon request indicator set to Followon request pending unless
1 the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or
2 the UE needs to perform the registration procedure for initial registration for emergency services.
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The registration procedure for initial registration is started if still necessary when timer T3447 expires or timer T3447 is stopped.
m UE is not registered to the access other than the access the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received and the 5GS registration result value in the 5GS registration result IE value in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is set to 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
The UE shall consider itself as being registered to only the access where the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received.
n Access for localized services in current SNPN is no longer allowed.
If the initial registration request is neither for emergency services nor for initiating a PDU session for emergency services with request type set to existing emergency PDU session the selected SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 and
1 access for localized services in SNPN is disabled or
2 the validity information for the selected SNPN is no longer met
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter stop T3510 abort the registration procedure for initial registration locally release the NAS signalling connection if any and enter state 5GMMDEREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE or 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH in order to perform SNPN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
For the cases c d and e the UE shall proceed as follows
Timer T3510 shall be stopped if still running.
If the registration procedure is neither an initial registration for emergency services nor for establishing an emergency PDU session with registration type not set to emergency registration the registration attempt counter shall be incremented unless it was already set to 5.
If the registration attempt counter is less than 5
if the initial registration request is not for emergency services timer T3511 is started and the state is changed to 5GMMDEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATION. When timer T3511 expires the registration procedure for initial registration shall be restarted if still required.
If the registration attempt counter is equal to 5
the UE shall delete TAI list and last visited registered TAI start timer T3502 if the value of the timer as indicated by the network is not zero and shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED. If the UE is not registering or has not registered to the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall additionally delete 5GGUTI ngKSI and list of equivalent PLMNs if any or list of equivalent SNPNs if any. The state is changed to 5GMMDEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATION or optionally to 5GMMDEREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection SNPN selection or SNPN selection for onboarding services according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
if the value of T3502 as indicated by the network is zero the UE shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3502.
if the procedure is performed via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode
the UE shall in addition handle the EMM parameters EPS update status EMM state 4GGUTI TAI list last visited registered TAI list of equivalent PLMNs and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 for the abnormal cases when an EPS attach procedure fails and the attach attempt counter is equal to 5 and
the UE shall attempt to select EUTRAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate EMM specific procedures. Additionally The UE may disable the N1 mode capability as specified in subclause 4.9.
###### 5.5.1.2.8	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure
If a lower layer failure occurs before the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message has been received from the UE and timer T3550 is running the AMF shall locally abort the registration procedure for initial registration enter state 5GMMREGISTERED and shall not resend the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If a new 5GGUTI was assigned to the UE in the registration procedure for initial registration the AMF shall consider both the old and the new 5GGUTI as valid until the old 5GGUTI can be considered as invalid by the AMF or the 5GMM context which has been marked as deregistered in the AMF is released. If the old 5GGUTI was allocated by an AMF other than the current AMF the current AMF does not need to retain the old 5GGUTI. During this period the network may use the identification procedure followed by a generic UE configuration update procedure if the old 5GGUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent message.
b Protocol error
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is received with a protocol error the AMF shall return a REGISTRATION REJECT message with one of the following 5GMM cause values
#111	protocol error, unspecified.
c T3550 timeout
On the first expiry of the timer the AMF shall retransmit the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and shall reset and restart timer T3550.
This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3550 the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and the AMF enters state 5GMMREGISTERED. If a new 5GGUTI was allocated in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the AMF shall consider both the old and the new 5GGUTIs as valid until the old 5GGUTI can be considered as invalid by the AMF or the 5GMM context which has been marked as deregistered in the AMF is released. If the old 5GGUTI was allocated by an AMF other than the current AMF the current AMF does not need to retain the old 5GGUTI. During this period if the old 5GGUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent message the AMF acts as specified for case a above.
d REGISTRATION REQUEST message received after the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message has been sent and before the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is received if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is expected.
1 If one or more of the information elements in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous REGISTRATION REQUEST message the previously initiated the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message has not been received and the new registration procedure for initial registration shall be progressed or
2 if the information elements do not differ then the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall be resent and the timer T3550 shall be restarted. In that case the retransmission counter related to T3550 is not incremented.
e More than one REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration received and no REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message has been sent.
1 If one or more of the information elements in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration differs from the ones received within the previous REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration the previously initiated the registration procedure for initial registration shall be aborted and the new the registration procedure for initial registration shall be executed
2 if the information elements do not differ then the network shall continue with the previous the registration procedure for initial registration and shall ignore the second REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
f REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration received in state 5GMMREGISTERED.
If a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to initial registration is received in state 5GMMREGISTERED the network may initiate the 5GMM common procedures if it turned out that the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was sent by a genuine UE that has already been registered the 5GMM context if any are deleted and the new REGISTRATION REQUEST is progressed otherwise if network considers REGISTRATION REQUEST message was not sent by a genuine UE based on authentication procedure the network shall maintain the 5GMMcontext if any unchanged.
NOTE 1 The network can determine that the UE is genuine by executing the authentication procedure as described in subclause 5.4.1.
g REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating received before REGISTRATION COMPLETE message if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is expected.
Timer T3550 shall be stopped. The allocated 5GGUTI in the registration procedure for initial registration shall be considered as valid and the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be progressed as described in subclause 5.5.1.3.
h DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message received before REGISTRATION COMPLETE message if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is expected.
The AMF shall abort the registration procedure for initial registration and shall progress the deregistration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.2.2.
i UE security capabilities invalid or unacceptable
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is received with invalid or unacceptable UE security capabilities e.g. no 5GS encryption algorithms all bits zero no 5GS integrity algorithms all bits zero mandatory 5GS encryption algorithms not supported or mandatory 5GS integrity algorithms not supported etc. the AMF shall return a REGISTRATION REJECT message.
NOTE 2 5GMM cause value to be used in REGISTRATION REJECT message is up to the network implementation.
j Based on operator policy if the initial registration request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall reject the initial registration with a 5GMM cause value other than the 5GMM cause #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only.
NOTE 3 5GMM cause #7 5GS services not allowed 5GMM cause #11 PLMN not allowed 5GMM cause #27 N1 mode not allowed 5GMM cause #73 Serving network not authorized can be used depending on the subscription of the UE and whether the UE roams or not.
###### 5.5.1.3.1	General
This procedure is used by a UE for both mobility and periodic registration update of 5GS services. This procedure when used for periodic registration update of 5GS services is performed only in 3GPP access.
This procedure used for periodic registration update of 5GS services is controlled in the UE by timer T3512. When timer T3512 expires the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update is started. Start and reset of timer T3512 is described in subclause 10.2.
If the MUSIM UE is registered for emergency services and initiates a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update the network shall not indicate the support of
the NAS signalling connection release
the paging indication for voice services
the reject paging request or
the paging restriction
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

neither active PDU sessions nor PDN connections to transfer associated with mapped SNSSAIs
and has a default configured NSSAI then the UE shall
a include the SNSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI and
b include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default configured NSSAI indication bit set to Requested NSSAI created from default configured NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

neither active PDU sessions nor PDN connections to transfer associated with an SNSSAI applicable in the current PLMN or SNPN
neither active PDU sessions nor PDN connections to transfer associated with mapped SNSSAIs and
no default configured NSSAI
the UE shall include neither Requested NSSAI IE nor Requested mapped NSSAI IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If all the SNSSAIs corresponding to the slices to which the UE intends to register are included in the pending NSSAI the UE shall not include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
When the UE storing a pending NSSAI intends to register to additional SNSSAIs over the same access type the UE shall send the requested NSSAI containing the additional SNSSAIs that the UE intends to register to in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. The requested NSSAI shall not include any SNSSAI from the pending NSSAI.
The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or more SNSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the current PLMN or SNPN where any included SNSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI nor associated to an SNSSAI in the rejected NSSAI. If the UE is inside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI in the rejected NSSAI with a rejection cause value set to SNSSAI not available in the current registration area the SNSSAI may be included in the requested NSSAI.
For case zq the subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or more SNSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the current PLMN or SNPN where any included SNSSAI is in the partially rejected NSSAI and the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is not rejected. If the UE is inside the NSAoS of an SNSSAI in the partially rejected NSSAI and the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is rejected the SNSSAI may be included in the requested NSSAI.
In addition if the NSSRG information is available the subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value. The UE may also include in the requested NSSAI included in the Requested NSSAI IE or the Requested mapped NSSAI IE or both the SNSSAIs which were added to configured NSSAI in S1 mode and for which the associated NSSRG information is not available. If the UE is in 5GMMREGISTERED state over the other access and has already an allowed NSSAI for the other access in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs all the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI included in the Requested NSSAI IE or the Requested mapped NSSAI IE or both for the current access shall share at least an NSSRG value common to all the SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI for the other access. If the UE is simultaneously performing the registration procedure on the other access in different PLMNs the UE shall include SNSSAIs that share at least a common NSSRG value across all access types. If the UE has pending NSSAI which the UE is still interested in using then SNSSAIs in the pending NSSAI and requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one common NSSRG value.
NOTE 11 If the UE has stored mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI and one or more SNSSAIs in the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are not included in the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI then a SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI associated to one or more of these mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are available to be included in the requested NSSAI together with their mapped SNSSAI.
NOTE 12 If one or more mapped SNSSAIs in the stored mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are not included in the stored rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA a SNSSAI in the configured NSSAI associated to one or more of these mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI are available to be included in the registration request together with their mapped SNSSAI.
NOTE 13 There is no need to consider the case that the UE is simultaneously performing the registration procedure on the other access in the same PLMN due to that the UE is not allowed to initiate the registration procedure over one access when the registration over the other access to the same PLMN is going on.
If
a the UE is registered to current PLMN over the other access and has NSSRG information available
b the UE is attempting mobility registration to the same current PLMN from other PLMN in the current access and
c the UE has PDU sessions or PDN connections associated with NSSAI not sharing part of NSSRG available of the current PLMN
then the UE locally releases these PDU sessions or PDN connections as the NSSAI for these PDU sessions or PDN connections will not be included in the requested or the requested mapped NSSAI in the current PLMN due to its lack of association to the common NSSRG of the current PLMN.
The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of one or more SNSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for this PLMN.
If the UE supports the SNSSAI time validity information SNSSAI time validity information is available for an SNSSAI and the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is not available the UE shall not include the SNSSAI in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE has SNSSAI time validity information over the other access in the same PLMN and the SNSSAI time validity information indicates that the SNSSAI is not available the UE shall not include the SNSSAI in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message for the current access type.
NOTE 14 How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific. The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers e.g. policies like URSP applications and UE local configuration into account.
NOTE 14A If the UE determines the ondemand SNSSAI for a PDU session establishment as specified in subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 the UE includes the ondemand SNSSAI in the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure.

For a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with a 5GS registration type IE indicating mobility registration updating if the UE does not indicate support for network slicespecific authentication and authorization the UE is not registered for onboarding services in SNPN and
a the UE is not in NBN1 mode and
b if
1 the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message or
2 none of the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message are allowed
and one or more default SNSSAIs which are not subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization are available the AMF shall
a put the allowed SNSSAIs for the current PLMN or SNPN each of which corresponds to a default SNSSAI and not subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization in the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
b put the default SNSSAIs and not subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization as the mapped SNSSAIs for the allowed NSSAI in roaming scenarios in the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and
c determine a registration area such that all SNSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI are available in the registration area.
During a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update for which the 5GS registration type IE indicates

2 the SMF may initiate the PDU session release procedure.
NOTE 13 According to 3GPP TS 23.501 also the AMF will determine which PDU sessions can no longer be supported based on the new allowed NSSAI and it will cause a release on the UE side either by indicating in the PDU session status IE which PDU sessions are inactive on the network side or by triggering the SMF to initiate a release via 5GSM signalling.
NOTE 13AA If a dedicated SNSSAI for MWAB is not included in the new allowed NSSAI then the AMF can decide not to indicate in the PDU session status IE a PDU session associated with the SNSSAI and DNN combination for MWAB as inactive on the network side and to delay the notification of the SMF associated with the PDU session to initiate the networkrequested PDU session release procedure for a locally configured time.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains a configured NSSAI IE with a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN and optionally the mapped SNSSAIs for the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN the UE shall store the contents of the configured NSSAI IE as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

the AMF may decide to provide the LADN service area for that LADN DNN of the extended LADN information as the LADN information and include the LADN information in the LADN information IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
NOTE 15A If the LADN service area is configured per DNN and SNSSAI in order to serve the UEs that do not support LADN per DNN and SNSSAI it is recommended that the LADN DNN is only served by a single SNSSAI.
NOTE 15B In case of the UE is subscribed to the LADN DNN for multiple SNSSAIs the AMF can treat this as no extended LADN information is available.
If the UE does not support LADN per DNN and SNSSAI and the AMF has neither the LADN information nor the extended LADN information the AMF shall not provide any LADN information to the UE.
If the AMF does not include
the LADN information IE or
the Extended LADN information IE in the Registration accept type 6 IE container IE
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message during registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update the UE shall delete its old LADN information or old extended LADN information respectively.
If the PDU session status IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
a for single access PDU sessions the UE shall perform a local release of all those PDU sessions associated with the access type the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is sent over which are not in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE or PDU SESSION ACTIVE PENDING on the UE side but are indicated by the AMF as being in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE. If a locally released PDU session is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions and
b for MA PDU sessions for all those PDU sessions which are not in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE and have the corresponding user plane resources being established or established in the UE on the access the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is sent over but are indicated by the AMF as no user plane resources are being established or established

In a UE with IMS voice over PS session capability the IMS voice over PS session indicator Emergency services support indicator and Emergency services fallback indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call the upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator Emergency services support indicator and Emergency services fallback indicator into account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS sessions in N1 mode then the UE shall not perform a local release of any persistent PDU session if the AMF does not indicate that the PDU session is in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE via the PDU session status IE. When the UE determines via the Emergency services support indicator that the network does not support emergency services in N1 mode then the UE shall not perform a local release of any emergency PDU session if userplane resources associated with that emergency PDU session are established if the AMF does not indicate that the PDU session is in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE via the PDU session status IE. In a UE with LCS capability location services indicators 5GLCS shall be provided to the upper layers. In a UE with the capability for ATSSS the network support for ATSSS shall be provided to the upper layers. If the UE receives the 5GS network feature support IE with the ATSSS support indicator set to ATSSS not supported the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session if any. If a locally released MA PDU session is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions. In a UE that supports non3GPP access path switching the network support for non3GPP access path switching shall be provided to the upper layers. If the UE receives the 5GS network feature support IE with the NAPS bit set to non3GPP access path switching not supported the UE shall not perform the registration procedure for mobility registration update for non3GPP access path switching.
NOTE 16A If the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non3GPP accesses the UE uses the capability received over non3GPP access to determine whether to initiate the registration procedure for mobility registration update for non3GPP path switching.
The AMF shall set the EMF bit in the 5GS network feature support IE to
a Emergency services fallback supported in NR connected to 5GCN and EUTRA connected to 5GCN if the network supports the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an NR cell connected to 5GCN or an EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN
b Emergency services fallback supported in NR connected to 5GCN only if the network supports the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an NR cell connected to 5GCN and does not support the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN
c Emergency services fallback supported in EUTRA connected to 5GCN only if the network supports the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN and does not support the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in an NR cell connected to 5GCN or
d Emergency services fallback not supported if network does not support the emergency services fallback procedure when the UE is in any cell connected to 5GCN.
NOTE 17 If the emergency services are supported in neither the EPS nor the 5GS homogeneously based onoperator policy the AMF will set the EMF bit in the 5GS network feature support IE to Emergency services fallback not supported.
NOTE 18 Even though the AMFs support of emergency services fallback is indicated per RAT the UEs support of emergency services fallback is not per RAT i.e. the UEs support of emergency services fallback is the same for both NR connected to 5GCN and EUTRA connected to 5GCN.
If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and
a in WBN1 mode the AMF decides to restrict the use of CE mode B for the UE then the AMF shall set the RestrictEC bit to CE mode B is restricted
b in WBN1 mode the AMF decides to restrict the use of both CE mode A and CE mode B for the UE then the AMF shall set the RestrictEC bit to Both CE mode A and CE mode B are restricted or
c in NBN1 mode the AMF decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE then the AMF shall set the RestrictEC bit to Use of enhanced coverage is restricted
in the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
Access identity 1 is only applicable while the UE is in N1 mode. Access identity 2 is only applicable while the UE is in N1 mode.
When the UE is registered to the same PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP and non3GPP access the UE and the AMF maintain one MPS indicator and one MCS indicator that are common to both 3GPP and non3GPP access. When the UE is registered to different PLMNs or SNPNs over 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE maintains two MPS indicators and two MCS indicators separately for different accesses i.e. an MPS indicator and an MCS indicator for the 3GPP access and another MPS indicator and an MCS indicator for the non3GPP access. For both 3GPP and non3GPP access the access identity is determined according to subclause 4.5.2

###### 5.5.1.3.5	Mobility and periodic registration update not accepted by the network
If the mobility and periodic registration update request cannot be accepted by the network the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.
If the mobility and periodic registration update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
If the mobility and periodic registration update request is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control for an SNPN providing access localized services in SNPN the network may set an appropriate cause value other than 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and does not assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
In NBN1 mode if the mobility and periodic registration update request is rejected due to operator determined barring see 3GPP TS 29.503 20AB the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
When the UE performs intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode if the AMF is informed that verification of the integrity protection of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message included by the UE in the EPS NAS message container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has failed in the MME then
a If the AMF can retrieve the current 5G NAS security context as indicated by the ngKSI and 5GGUTI sent by the UE the AMF shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.4
b if the AMF cannot retrieve the current 5G NAS security context as indicated by the ngKSI and 5GGUTI sent by the UE or the ngKSI or 5GGUTI was not sent by the UE the AMF may initiate the identification procedure by sending the IDENTITY REQUEST message with the Type of identity of the 5GS identity type IE set to SUCI before taking actions as specified in subclause 4.4.4.3 or
c If the AMF needs to reject the mobility and periodic registration update procedure the AMF shall send REGISTRATION REJECT message including 5GMM cause #9 UE identity cannot be derived by the network.
If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #76 or #78 was received without integrity protection then the UE shall discard the message. If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #62 was received without integrity protected the behaviour of the UE is specified in subclause 5.3.20.2.
Based on operator policy if the mobility and periodic registration update request is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #31 Redirection to EPC required.
NOTE 1 The network can take into account the UEs S1 mode capability the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the EPC to determine the rejection with the 5GMM cause value #31 Redirection to EPC required.
If the mobility and periodic registration update request is rejected because
a all the SNSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI i.e. Requested NSSAI IE or Requested mapped NSSAI IE are rejected
b the UE set the NSSAA bit in the 5GMM capability IE to
1 Network slicespecific authentication and authorization supported and
i void
ii all default SNSSAIs are not allowed or
iii network slicespecific authentication and authorization has failed or been revoked for all default SNSSAIs and based on network local policy the network decides not to initiate the network slicespecific reauthentication and reauthorization procedures for any default SNSSAI requested by the UE or
2 Network slicespecific authentication and authorization not supported and all subscribed default SNSSAIs marked as default are either not allowed or are subject to network slicespecific authentication and authorization and
i void or
ii void and
c no emergency PDU session has been established for the UE
the network shall set the 5GMM cause value of the REGISTRATION REJECT message to #62 No network slices available and shall include in the rejected NSSAI of the REGISTRATION REJECT message all the SNSSAIs which were included in the requested NSSAI.
If the UE has set the ERNSSAI bit to Extended rejected NSSAI supported in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message. Otherwise the rejected SNSSAIs shall be included in the Rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
In roaming scenarios if the Extended rejected NSSAI IE is included in the REGISTRATION REJECT message the AMF shall provide mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI.
If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the AMF determines that maximum number of UEs reached for one or more SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5 the AMF shall include the rejected NSSAI containing one or more SNSSAIs with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message. In addition the AMF may include a backoff timer value for each SNSSAI with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
If the mobility and periodic registration update request from a UE supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only and should include the CAG information list in the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.
NOTE 2 The network cannot be certain that CAG information list stored in the UE is updated as result of sending of the REGISTRATION REJECT message with the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE as the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not necessarily delivered to the UE e.g due to abnormal radio conditions.
NOTE 3 The CAG information list can be provided by the AMF and include no entry if no CAG information list exists in the subscription.
NOTE 3A If the UE supports extended CAG information list the CAG information list can be included either in the CAG information list IE or Extended CAG information list IE.
NOTE 3B It is unexpected for network to send REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE with 5GMM cause value #76 in nonCAG cell and not indicate Indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the serving PLMN in the Extended CAG information list or the CAG information list.
If the UE does not support extended CAG information list the CAG information list shall not be included in the Extended CAG information list IE.
If the mobility and periodic registration update request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall operate as described in bullet i of subclause 5.5.1.3.8.

If the UE initiates the registration procedure for disaster roaming and the AMF determines that it does not support providing disaster roaming services for the determined PLMN with disaster condition to the UE then the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #80 “Disaster roaming for the determined PLMN with disaster condition not allowed”.
If the AMF receives the mobility and periodic registration update request over non3GPP access and detects that the N3IWF used by the UE is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and the UE has indicated its support for slicebased N3IWF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF may send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #81 Selected N3IWF is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and may provide information for a suitable N3IWF in the REGISTRATION REJECT message indicating the suitable N3IWF that is compatible with the requested NSSAI.
If the AMF receives the mobility and periodic registration update request over non3GPP access and detects that the TNGF used by the UE is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and the UE has indicated its support for slicebased TNGF selection in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF may send a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #82 Selected TNGF is not compatible with the allowed NSSAI and may provide information for a suitable TNAN in the TNAN information IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message indicating the suitable TNGF that is compatible with the requested NSSAI.
If the AMF received multiple TAIs from the satellite NGRAN as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 and determines that by UE subscription and operators preferences all of the received TAIs are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service the AMF shall include the TAIs in
a the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE or

10 the UE needs to report unavailability information due to discontinuous coverage.
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.
NOTE 1 It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a nonsuccessful case.
If the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update was initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call i.e. access category 4 for an MO MMTEL video call i.e. access category 5 for an MO IMS registration related signalling i.e. access category 9 or for NAS signalling connection recovery during an ongoing MO MMTEL voice call i.e. access category 4 or during an MO MMTEL video call i.e. access category 5 or during an ongoing MO IMS registration related signalling i.e. access category 9 then a notification that the procedure was not initiated due to network congestion shall be provided to upper layers.
b The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred.
The UE shall not start the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Receipt of the access barred indication shall not trigger the selection of a different core network type EPC or 5GCN.

o UE is not registered to the access other than the access the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received and the 5GS registration result value in the 5GS registration result IE value in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is set to 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
The UE shall consider itself as being registered to only the access where the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received.
p Access for localized services in current SNPN is no longer allowed.
If the mobility and periodic registration update is not for initiating an emergency PDU session the registered SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 and
access for localized services in SNPN is disabled or
the validity information for the selected SNPN is no longer met
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter stop T3510 abort the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update locally release the NAS signalling connection if any and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH in order to perform SNPN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
For the cases c d and e the UE shall proceed as follows
Timer T3510 shall be stopped if still running.
If the registration procedure is not for initiating an emergency PDU session the registration attempt counter shall be incremented unless it was already set to 5.
If the registration attempt counter is less than 5
if the TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list or the 5GS update status is different to 5U1 UPDATED or if the registration procedure was triggered due to cases c g n v in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 the UE shall start timer T3511 shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and change to state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE. When timer T3511 expires the registration update procedure is triggered again.
if the TAI of the current serving cell is included in the TAI list the 5GS update status is equal to 5U1 UPDATED and the UE is not performing the registration procedure after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE shall keep the 5GS update status to 5U1 UPDATED and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE as described in subclause 5.3.5.2. The UE shall start timer T3511. If in addition the REGISTRATION REQUEST message did not include the MICO indication IE or the Extended DRX IE and
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicated periodic registration updating
the registration procedure was initiated to recover the NAS signalling connection due to RRC Connection failure from the lower layers
the registration procedure was initiated when the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication receives a fallback indication from lower layers or
the registration procedure was initiated by the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication entering a cell in the current registration area belonging to an equivalent PLMN of the registered PLMN and not belonging to the registered PLMN
and none of the other reasons for initiating the registration updating procedure listed in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 was applicable the timer T3511 may be stopped when the UE enters 5GMMCONNECTED mode.
if the TAI of the current serving cell is included in the TAI list the 5GS update status is equal to 5U1 UPDATED and the UE is performing the registration procedure after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE shall change the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.ATTEMPTINGREGISTRATIONUPDATE. The UE shall start timer T3511.
If the procedure is performed via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode the UE shall in addition handle the EPS update status as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 for the abnormal cases when a normal or periodic tracking area updating procedure fails and the tracking area attempt counter is less than 5 and the EPS update status is different from EU1 UPDATED.
If the registration attempt counter is equal to 5
the UE shall start timer T3502 if the value of the timer as indicated by the network is not zero shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED.

if the value of T3502 as indicated by the network is zero the UE shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3502.
NOTE 3 For case e if the lower layer failure is on a cell which was selected due to network slicebased cell reselection see 3GPP TS 23.501 the UE can as an implementation option change the SNSSAIs in the requested NSSAI to try and find a suitable NR cell.
if the procedure is performed via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode
the UE shall in addition handle the EPS update status as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 for the abnormal cases when a normal or periodic tracking area updating procedure fails and the tracking area attempt counter is equal to 5 and
if the UE does not change to state 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH the UE shall attempt to select EUTRAN radio access technology. The UE may disable the N1 mode capability as specified in subclause 4.9.
###### 5.5.1.3.8	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure
If a lower layer failure occurs before the message REGISTRATION COMPLETE has been received from the UE and timer T3550 is running the AMF shall abort the procedure enter 5GMMIDLE mode.
If a new 5GGUTI was assigned to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the AMF shall consider both the old and new 5GGUTIs as valid until the old 5GGUTI can be considered as invalid by the AMF. If a new TAI list was provided in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message both the old and new TAI lists shall also be considered valid until the old TAI list can be considered invalid by the AMF. If the old 5GGUTI was allocated by an AMF other than the current AMF the current AMF does not need to retain the old 5GGUTI.
Additionally if the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes
1 Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE
i containing a new Paging subgroup ID and the UE is previously assigned a different Paging subgroup ID then the AMF shall consider both the old and new Paging subgroup IDs as valid until the old Paging subgroup ID can be considered as invalid by the AMF or
NOTE 0 If the UE was not previously assigned a paging subgroup ID by the AMF then AMF informs RAN about the new PEIPS assistance information i.e. paging subgroup ID and it is up to RAN how to handle the old information at RAN and new information from AMF so that the paging is not missed.
ii containing no Paging subgroup ID or no Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE then the AMF shall delete any old Paging subgroup ID stored in the 5GMM context of the UE.
2 Negotiated WUS assistance information IE
i containing a new UE paging probability information value and the UE is previously assigned a different UE paging probability information value then the AMF shall consider both the old and new UE paging probability information values as valid until the old UE paging probability information value can be considered as invalid by the AMF or
ii containing no UE paging probability information value or no Negotiated WUS assistance information IE then the AMF shall delete any old UE paging probability information value stored in the 5GMM context of the UE.
During this period
1 if the new 5GGUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent message then
i the AMF shall consider the old 5GGUTI as invalid and additionally the old TAI list as invalid if a new TAI list was provided with the new 5GGUTI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
ii if the AMF assigns a new Paging subgroup ID to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message then the AMF shall consider the new Paging subgroup ID as valid and the old Paging subgroup ID if any as invalid and
iii if the AMF assigns a new UE paging probability information value in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message then the AMF shall consider the new UE paging probability information value as valid and the old UE paging probability information value if any as invalid.
2 if the old 5GGUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent message the AMF may use the identification procedure followed by a generic UE configuration update procedure. If the AMF in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
i assigns a new Paging subgroup ID to the UE then the AMF shall include the PEIPS assistance information or
ii does not assign a Paging subgroup ID to the UE then the AMF shall not include the PEIPS assistance information
and initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure and
3 if the UE needs to be paged
i if in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message a new Paging subgroup ID in the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE is assigned to the UE
that previously has no Paging subgroup ID assigned then the AMF shall use the new Paging subgroup ID for paging the UE
that is same as the old Paging subgroup ID then the AMF shall use the same Paging subgroup ID for paging the UE or
that is different than the old Paging subgroup ID then the AMF may first use the old Paging subgroup ID followed by the new Paging subgroup ID for paging the UE.
ii if in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message a new UE paging probability information value in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE is assigned to the UE
that previously has no UE paging probability information value assigned then the AMF shall use the new UE paging probability information value for paging the UE
that is same as the old UE paging probability information value then the AMF shall use the same UE paging probability information value for paging the UE or
that is different than the old UE paging probability information value then the AMF may first use the old UE paging probability information value followed by the new UE paging probability information value for paging the UE.
iii the AMF selects the 5GGUTI and TAI list as follows
the AMF may first use the old 5GSTMSI from the old 5GGUTI for paging within the area defined by the old TAI list for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts using the selected Paging subgroup ID or the selected UE paging probability information value in the WUS assistance information IE. If a new TAI list was provided in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the new TAI list should also be used for paging. Upon response from the UE the AMF may initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure. If the response is received from a tracking area within the old and new TAI list the network shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure. If in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message a new Paging subgroup ID was assigned to the UE that is different than the old Paging subgroup ID then the network shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure and
if no response is received to the paging attempts using the old 5GSTMSI from the old 5GGUTI and the old Paging subgroup ID or the old UE paging probability information value in the WUS assistance information IE the AMF may use the new 5GSTMSI from the new 5GGUTI and the new Paging subgroup ID or the new UE paging probability information value in the WUS assistance information IE if any for paging for an implementation dependent number of paging attempts. In this case if a new TAI list was provided with the new 5GGUTI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the new TAI list shall be used instead of the old TAI list.
b Protocol error.
If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has been received with a protocol error the AMF shall return a REGISTRATION REJECT message with one of the following 5GMM cause values
#111	protocol error, unspecified.
c T3550 time out.
On the first expiry of the timer the AMF shall retransmit the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and shall reset and restart timer T3550. The retransmission is performed four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3550 the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update procedure is aborted.
During this period the AMF acts as described for case a above.
d REGISTRATION REQUEST with 5GS registration type IE set to mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating received after the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message has been sent and before the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is received if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is expected.
1 If one or more of the information elements in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous REGISTRATION REQUEST message the previously initiated registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be aborted if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message has not been received and the new registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be progressed or
2 if the information elements do not differ then the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall be resent and timer T3550 shall be restarted. In that case the retransmission counter related to timer T3550 is not incremented.
e More than one REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE set to mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating received and neither REGISTRATION ACCEPT message nor REGISTRATION REJECT message has been sent.
1 If one or more of the information elements in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message differs from the ones received within the previous REGISTRATION REQUEST message the previously initiated registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be aborted and the new registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update shall be progressed or
2 if the information elements do not differ then the network shall continue with the previous registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and shall not treat any further this REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
f Lower layers indication of nondelivered NAS PDU due to handover.
If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists the AMF shall retransmit the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message.
g DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message received before REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is received if the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message is expected.
If the Deregistration type IE is set to switch off
The AMF shall abort the signalling for the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update towards the UE and shall progress the deregistration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.2.2.
NOTE 1 Internally in the AMF before processing the deregistration request the AMF can perform the necessary signalling procedures for the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update before progressing the deregistration procedure.
If the Deregistration type IE is set to other type than switch off
The AMF shall proceed with registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and shall progress the deregistration procedure after successful completion of the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.
h If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS registration type IE indicating periodic registration updating is received by the new AMF which does not have the 5GMM context data related to the subscription the new AMF may send the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #10 implicitly deregistered.
i Based on operator policy if the mobility and periodic registration update request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall reject the mobility and periodic registration update request with a 5GMM cause value other than the 5GMM cause #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only.
NOTE 2 5GMM cause #7 5GS services not allowed 5GMM cause #11 PLMN not allowed 5GMM cause #27 N1 mode not allowed 5GMM cause #73 Serving network not authorized can be used depending on the subscription of the UE and whether the UE roams or not.
##### 5.5.2.1	General
The deregistration procedure is used
a by the UE to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access
b by the UE to deregister for 5GS services over non3GPP access when the UE is registered over non3GPP access
c by the UE to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses
c1 by the UE to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access when an event is triggered in the UE that would make the UE unavailable for a certain period of time and the UE is not able to store its 5GMM and 5GSM contexts
NOTE 1 If the UE is able to store its 5GMM and 5GSM contexts the UE triggers the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.
d by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access
e by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS services over non3GPP access when the UE is registered over non3GPP access
f by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS services over 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses
g by the network to inform the UE to reregister to the network
h by the network to inform the UE supporting UAS service that it is deregistered for UAS services in 5GS and
i by the network to inform the UE operating as MBSR that it is deregistered for MBSR in 5GS.
The deregistration procedure with appropriate deregistration type shall be invoked by the UE
a if the UE is switched off
b as part of the eCall inactivity procedure defined in subclause 5.5.3 and
c as part of USIM removal.
The deregistration procedure with appropriate deregistration type shall be invoked by the network
a if the network informs whether the UE should reregister to the network.
The deregistration procedure with appropriate access type shall be invoked by the UE
a to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access
b to deregister for 5GS services over non3GPP access when the UE is registered over non3GPP access
c to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses or
d to deregister for 5GS services over 3GPP access if the UE is registered for disaster roaming over 3GPP access and has successfully registered over non3GPP access on another PLMN
e void
The deregistration procedure with appropriate access type shall be invoked by the network
a if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access
b if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over non3GPP access when the UE is registered over non3GPP access or
c if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses.
If the deregistration procedure is triggered due to USIM removal the UE shall indicate switch off in the Deregistration type IE.
If the deregistration procedure is requested by the network for a UE that has an emergency PDU session the AMF shall not send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE and indicate to the SMF to release all nonemergency PDU sessions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 .
If the deregistration procedure for 5GS services is performed a local release of the PDU sessions over the indicated accesses if any for this particular UE is performed. If a PDU session that will be released is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions the UE is considered as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.
The UE is allowed to initiate the deregistration procedure even if the timer T3346 is running.
NOTE 2 When the UE has no PDU sessions over non3GPP access or the UE moves all the PDU sessions over a non3GPP access to a 3GPP access the UE and the AMF need not initiate deregistration over the non3GPP access.
The AMF shall provide the UE with a non3GPP deregistration timer.
When the AMF enters the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED for 3GPP access the AMF shall delete the stored UE radio capability information or the UE radio capability ID if any.
When upper layers indicate that emergency services are no longer required the UE if still registered for emergency services may perform UEinitiated deregistration procedure followed by a reregistration to regain normal services if the UE is in or moves to a suitable cell.
If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN after completing the configuration of one or more entries of the list of subscriber data the UE should perform UEinitiated deregistration procedure. To prevent the UE registered for onboarding services in SNPN from staying on the ONSNPN or to prevent a UE whose subscription only allows for configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane from staying registered indefinitely when an implementation specific timer expires
if the AMF considers that the UE is in 5GMMIDLE the AMF shall locally deregisters the UE or
if the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED the AMF shall initiate the networkinitiated deregistration procedure see subclause 5.5.2.3.
NOTE 3 The value of the implementation specific timer for onboarding services needs to be large enough to allow a UE to complete the configuration of one or more entries of the list of subscriber data taking into consideration that configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane or onboarding services in SNPN involves third party entities outside of the operators network.
NOTE 4 How to determine the completion of the configuration of one or more entries of the list of subscriber data is UE implementation specific.
If the deregistration procedure is not due to switch off and upper layers request establishing an emergency PDU session before the deregistration procedure has been completed the UE shall abort the deregistration procedure perform local deregistration and initiate a registration procedure.
If the UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode determines to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN due to SOR then based on the conditions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 annex C where applicable the UE shall perform UEinitiated deregistration procedure.
If the UE is registered for disaster roaming services and the UE receives an indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE set to Disaster roaming is disabled in the UE in a UE parameters update transparent container the UE shall perform UEinitiated deregistration procedure.
###### 5.5.2.2.1	UE-initiated de-registration procedure initiation
The deregistration procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message see example in figure 5.5.2.2.1. The Deregistration type IE included in the message indicates whether the deregistration procedure is due to a switch off or not. The access type included in the message indicates whether the deregistration procedure is
a for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access
b for 5GS services over non3GPP access when the UE is registered over non3GPP access or
c for 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses.
If the UE has a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with the valid 5GGUTI.
NOTE 1 In some abnormal cases the 5GGUTI can be a 5GGUTI mapped from a valid native 4GGUTI see subclause 5.5.1.2.7 item f and subclause 5.5.1.3.7 item l.
If the UE does not have a valid 5GGUTI the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with its SUCI as follows
a if timer T3519 is not running and the deregistration is not due to USIM removal generate a fresh SUCI as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with the SUCI start timer T3519 and store the value of the SUCI sent in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and
b if timer T3519 is running send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with the stored SUCI.
If the UE does not have a valid 5GGUTI and it does not have a valid SUCI then the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with its PEI.
NOTE 2 During the initial registration for emergency services when the UE with no USIM or invalid USIM is in 5GMMREGISTEREDINITIATED state the UE has neither a valid 5GGUTI nor a valid SUCI.
If the deregistration request is not due to switch off and the UE is in the state 5GMMREGISTERED or 5GMMREGISTEREDINITIATED timer T3521 shall be started in the UE after the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent. The UE shall enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED.
If the UE is to be switched off the UE shall try for a period of 5 seconds to send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. During this period the UE may be switched off as soon as the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent.
If the network indicated support for the unavailability period in the last registration procedure and an event is triggered in the UE that would make the UE unavailable for a certain period the use of unavailability period is not due to NR satellite access discontinuous coverage and the UE is unable to store its 5GMM and 5GSM contexts the UE shall include the unavailability period duration in the Unavailability information IE set the Unavailability type to unavailability due to UE reasons and set the Deregistration type IE to Normal deregistration in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The UE shall start the timer T3521 and enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED.
If the UE is sending the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message from 5GMMIDLE mode and the UE needs to send noncleartext IEs the UE shall send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the NAS message container IE as described in subclause 4.4.6.
The 5GRG shall not initiate the deregistration procedure for itself until it successfully deregisters all the AUN3 devices connected to it if any by initiating the deregistration procedure on behalf of the AUN3 device.
Figure 5.5.2.2.1.1 UEinitiated deregistration procedure
###### 5.5.2.2.2	UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion
When the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received by the AMF the AMF shall send a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE if the Deregistration type IE does not indicate switch off. Otherwise the procedure is completed when the AMF receives the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The UE when receiving the DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall stop timer T3521 stop timer T3519 if running and delete any stored SUCI.
###### 5.5.2.2.3	UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over 3GPP access
If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates that the deregistration procedure is for 3GPP access the AMF shall trigger the SMF to perform a local release of the PDU sessions established over 3GPP access if any for this UE. The UE shall perform a local release of the PDU sessions established over 3GPP access if any. If a PDU session is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions and the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions. If there is an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on both 3GPP access and non3GPP access in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform release of user plane resources on 3GPP access and the UE shall consider the user plane resources on 3GPP access as released. If there is an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on 3GPP access only the AMF shall trigger the SMF to perform a local release of the MA PDU session and the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. If the MA PDU session is associated with one or more MBS multicast sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions. The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for 3GPP access. The AMF shall enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED for 3GPP access.
If the UE supports N1 mode only and the deregistration request is not due to switch off then
a if the deregistration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services then the UE shall enter the 5GMMNULL state for 3GPP access
b otherwise the UE shall enter the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state for 3GPP access.
NOTE Case b is applicable when the UE is also registered over non3GPP access.
If the access type indicates that the deregistration procedure is for 3GPP access or for 3GPP access and non3GPP access and the UE is operating in singleregistration mode it shall additionally proceed as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 subclause 5.5.2.2.2 for the case when the UE receives an EMM message DETACH ACCEPT.
Furthermore if the UE supports AGb or Iu mode and the deregistration procedure was not performed
due to the last running Tsorcm timer expired or was stopped see 3GPP TS 23.122 subclause C.4.2
as part of eCall inactivity procedureor
due to switch off
the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access.
###### 5.5.2.2.4	UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over non-3GPP access
If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the deregistration procedure is for non3GPP access the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform a local release of the PDU sessions established over non3GPP access if any for this UE. The UE shall perform a local release of the PDU sessions established over non3GPP access if any. If there is an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on both 3GPP access and non3GPP access in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform release of user plane resources on non3GPP access and the UE shall consider the user plane resources on non3GPP access as released. If there is an MA PDU session with a PDN connection as a userplane resource and user plane resources established on non3GPP access the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform release of user plane resources on non3GPP access and the UE shall consider the user plane resources on non3GPP access as released. If the UE has an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on non3GPP access only the AMF shall trigger the SMF to perform a local release of the MA PDU session and the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for non3GPP access. The AMF shall enter the state 5GMMDEREGISTERED over non3GPP access.
If the deregistration request is not due to switch off the UE shall
a if the deregistration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services enter the 5GMMNULL state for non3GPP access
b otherwise enter the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state for non3GPP access.
NOTE Case b is applicable when the UE is also registered over 3GPP access.
###### 5.5.2.2.5	UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the deregistration procedure is for both 3GPP access and non3GPP access when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses the descriptions for UEinitiated deregistration procedure completion for 5GS services over 3GPP access and over non3GPP access as specified in subclauses 5.5.2.2.3 and 5.5.2.2.4 shall be followed.
###### 5.5.2.2.6	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure or release of the N1 NAS signalling connection before reception of DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The deregistration procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows
1 if the deregistration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services the UE shall enter the 5GMMNULL state or
2 if the deregistration type normal deregistration was requested for reasons other than disabling of 5GS services the UE shall enter the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state.
b The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred.
The UE shall not start the signalling for the deregistration procedure. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Receipt of the access barred indication shall not trigger the selection of a different core network type EPC or 5GCN.
The UE may perform a local deregistration either immediately or after an implementationdependent time.
The signalling for the deregistration procedure is started if still needed when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated.
ba The lower layers indicate that
1 access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0 and 2 or
2 access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0.
If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has not been sent the UE shall proceed as specified for case b. If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent the UE shall proceed as specified for case a.

If the deregistration procedure was performed based on conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 annex C on the expiry of timer T3521 the deregistration procedure shall be aborted and the UE shall locally release the established N1 NAS signalling connection and enter the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state.
Otherwise on the first four expiries of the timer the UE shall retransmit the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T3521. On the fifth expiry of timer T3521 the deregistration procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows
1 if the deregistration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services the UE shall enter the 5GMMNULL state or
2 if the deregistration type normal deregistration was requested for reasons other than disabling of 5GS services the UE shall enter the 5GMMDEREGISTERED state.
d Deregistration procedure collision.
Deregistration containing deregistration type switch off
If the UE receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message before the UEinitiated deregistration procedure has been completed this message shall be ignored and the UEinitiated deregistration procedure shall continue.

###### 5.5.2.2.7	Abnormal cases in the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Deregistration request received in a cell belonging to an SNPN with a nongloballyunique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid subscription
If the UE initiates a deregistration procedure in a cell belonging to an SNPN with a nongloballyunique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid subscription and the deregistration procedure is not due to switch off the network shall initiate the deregistration procedure. The AMF shall send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the 5GMM cause #74 Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN.
b Deregistration request received in a cell belonging to an SNPN with a globallyunique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid subscription
If the UE initiates a deregistration procedure in a cell belonging to an SNPN with a globallyunique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid subscription and the deregistration procedure is not due to switch off the network shall initiate the deregistration procedure. The AMF shall send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the 5GMM cause #75 Permanently not authorized for this SNPN.
c Deregistration request received in a CAG cell and none of the CAG ID broadcasted by the CAG cell is authorized based on the UEs allowed CAG list for the current PLMN
If the UE initiates a deregistration procedure in a CAG cell and none of the CAG ID broadcasted by the CAG cell is authorized based on the UEs allowed CAG list for the current PLMN and the deregistration procedure is not due to switch off the AMF shall initiate the deregistration procedure. The AMF shall send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the 5GMM cause #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only if the UE supports CAG. Otherwise the network shall operate as described in bullet g of subclause 5.5.2.3.5.
d Deregistration request received in a nonCAG cell from a UE whose CAG information list includes an entry associated with the current PLMN where the entry contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells
If the UE initiates a deregistration procedure in a nonCAG cell from a UE whose CAG information list includes an entry associated with the current PLMN where the entry contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells and the deregistration procedure is not due to switch off the AMF shall initiate the deregistration procedure. The AMF shall send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the 5GMM cause #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only if the UE supports CAG. Otherwise the network shall operate as described in bullet g of subclause 5.5.2.3.5.
e Deregistration and registration procedure for initial registration collision
If the network receives a REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicating either initial registration or emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE from the UE before the UEinitiated deregistration procedure which is not due to switch off has been completed the network shall abort the deregistration procedure and the registration procedure shall be progressed.
###### 5.5.2.3.1	Network-initiated de-registration procedure initiation
The network initiates the deregistration procedure by sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE see example in figure 5.5.2.3.1.1.
NOTE 1 If the AMF performs a local deregistration it will inform the UE with a 5GMM messages e.g. SERVICE REJECT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #10 implicitly deregistered only when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure.
The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The network shall start timer T3522. The network shall indicate whether reregistration is needed or not in the Deregistration type IE. The network shall also indicate via the access type whether the deregistration procedure is
a for 3GPP access only
b for non3GPP access only or
c for 3GPP access non3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN for both accesses.
If the network deregistration is triggered due to network slicespecific authentication and authorization failure or revocation as specified in subclause 4.6.2.4 then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #62 No network slices available in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. In addition if the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI the AMF shall include the Extended rejected NSSAI IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message otherwise the AMF shall include the Rejected NSSAI IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
In roaming scenarios if the Extended rejected NSSAI IE is included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message the AMF shall provide mapped SNSSAIs for the rejected NSSAI.
If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the network deregistration is triggered due to mobility management based network slice admission control as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5 then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #62 No network slices available in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. In addition the network may include a backoff timer value for each SNSSAI with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the network deregistration is triggered for a UE supporting CAG due to CAG restrictions the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only and should include the CAG information list in the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
NOTE 2 If the UE supports extended CAG information list the CAG information list can be included either in the CAG information list IE or Extended CAG information list IE.
NOTE 3 It is unexpected for network to send REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE with 5GMM cause value #76 in nonCAG cell and not indicate Indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the serving PLMN in the Extended CAG information list or the CAG information list.
If the network deregistration is triggered for a UE not supporting CAG due to CAG restrictions the network shall operate as described in bullet g of subclause 5.5.2.3.5.
If the network deregistration is triggered because the network determines that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate see 3GPP TS 23.502 the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to #78 PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location.
If
a the UE indicates support of the RAT utilization control in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message over 3GPP access and
b the network determines to apply the RAT utilization control based on the operator policy
the AMF shall send the DEREGISTRATION REJECT message with the 5GMM cause value set to #15 No suitable cells in tracking area and include the RAT utilization control IE. In the RAT utilization control IE the AMF shall indicate that the access technology of the NGRAN cell on which the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is sent as restricted.
NOTE 3A Other restricted access technologies can be indicated in the RAT utilization control IE if any.
If the network deregistration is triggered due to
a an unsuccessful outcome of an ongoing UUAAMM procedure
b an UUAA revocation notification received from the UASNF for a UE supporting UAS service requesting UAS services or
c the UE not allowed to use UAS services via 5GS due to a change of the aerial UE subscription information
then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to #79 UAS services not allowed.
NOTE 4 If the UE supporting UAS service has requested other services than UAS services or if there are other ongoing network slicespecific authentication and authorization on pending NSSAIs it is then an operator policy or configuration decision whether to keep the UE supporting UAS service registered to the network but that UE supporting UAS services is not allowed to access UAS services via 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB.
If the network deregistration is triggered for a UE supporting MINT due to a disaster condition no longer being applicable in the current location of the UE the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #11 PLMN not allowed and may include a disaster return wait range in the Disaster return wait range IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the network deregistration is triggered because the AMF determines that by UE subscription and operators preferences all of the TAIs received from the satellite NGRAN are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service the AMF shall include the TAIs in
a the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE or
b the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE or
c both
in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the network deregistration is triggered because the AMF determines that the UE operating as an IABnode by subscription is not authorized for IABnode operation the AMF shall set the 5GMM cause value to #36 IABnode operation not authorized in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the network deregistration is triggered for a UE operating as MBSR due to the UE no longer being allowed to operate as MBSR based on the UE subscription and the local policy and
a if the UE is allowed to operate as a UE then the network shall indicate reregistration required in the Deregistration type IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message or
b if the UE is not allowed to operate as a UE then the network shall indicate reregistration not required in the Deregistration type IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message based on the local policy.
If the network deregistration is triggered due to the UE that was not allowed for MBSR operation becoming allowed to operate as MBSR based on the UE subscription and the local policy then the network shall indicate reregistration required in the Deregistration type IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The AMF shall trigger the SMF to release locally the PDU sessions over the indicated accesses if any for the UE and enter state 5GMMDEREGISTEREDINITIATED. If a PDU session is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.

If there is one or more SNSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the rejection cause SNSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached then for each SNSSAI the UE shall behave as follows
a stop the timer T3526 associated with the SNSSAI if running
b start the timer T3526 with
1 the backoff timer value received along with the SNSSAI if a backoff timer value is received along with the SNSSAI that is neither zero nor deactivated or
2 an implementation specific backoff timer value if no backoff timer value is received along with the SNSSAI and
c remove the SNSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the SNSSAI expires.
If the UE has an allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI that contains SNSSAIs which are not included in the rejected NSSAI the UE may stay in the current serving cell apply the normal cell reselection process and start an initial registration with a requested NSSAI that includes any SNSSAI from the allowed NSSAI or the configured NSSAI that is not in the rejected NSSAI.

the UE has user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMMIDLE or 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access
the UE has user data pending over non3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over non3GPP access
the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access receives an indication from the lower layers of non3GPP access that the access stratum connection is established between the UE and the network if T3346 is not running
the UE in 5GMMIDLE or 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access receives a request from the upper layers to perform emergency services fallback and performs emergency services fallback as specified in subclause 4.13.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502
the UE has to request resources for V2X communication over PC5
the UE has to request resources for 5G ProSe direct discovery over PC5 or 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5
the UE has to request resources for A2X communication over PC5
NOTE 2 The purpose for the UE to request resources for V2X communication over PC5 5G ProSe direct discovery over PC5 and 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 can be to perform the ranging and sidelink positioning service over PC5.
the MUSIM UE in 5GMMIDLE mode requests the network to remove the paging restriction
the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection or rejects the paging request from the network or
the UE supporting the reconnection to the network due to RAN timing synchronization status change receives an indication of a change in the RAN timing synchronization status.
This procedure shall not be used for
a initiating user data transfer or CIoT user data via the control plane or
b PDU session management related signalling other than for performing UErequested PDU session release procedure related to a PDU session for LADN or for performing the UErequested PDU session modification procedure to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status
when the UE is located outside the LADN service area.
In NBN1 mode this procedure shall not be used to request the establishment of userplane resources
a for a number of PDU sessions that exceeds the UE s maximum number of supported userplane resources if there is currently
1 no userplane resources established for the UE
2 userplane resources established for
i one PDU session and the Multiple userplane resources support bit was set to Multiple userplane resources not supported in the 5GMM capability IE or
ii two PDU sessions and the Multiple userplane resources support bit was set to Multiple userplane resources supported in the 5GMM capability IE or
b for additional PDU sessions if the number of PDU sessions for which userplane resources are currently established is equal to the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources.
The service request procedure is initiated by the UE however it can be triggered by the network by means of
the paging procedure see subclause 5.6.2 for the transfer of downlink signalling or user data pending over 3GPP access to a UE in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access
the paging procedure see subclause 5.6.2 for the transfer of downlink signalling or user data pending over non3GPP access to a UE in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access
the notification procedure see subclause 5.6.3 for the transfer of downlink signalling or user data pending over non3GPP access to a UE in 5GMMCONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMMIDLE mode over non3GPP access or

The AMF shall not indicate to the SMF to release the emergency PDU session. If the AMF indicated to the SMF to perform a local release of all nonemergency PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access if it is due to CAG restrictions the network shall behave as if the UE is registered for emergency services.
If the PDU session reactivation result IE is included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message indicating that the userplane resources have been successfully reactivated for a PDU session that was indicated by the UE in the Allowed PDU session status IE as allowed to be reestablished over 3GPP access the UE considers the corresponding PDU session to be associated with the 3GPP access. If the userplane resources of a PDU session have been successfully reactivated over the 3GPP access the AMF and SMF update the associated access type of the corresponding PDU session.
If the userplane resources cannot be established for a PDU session the AMF shall include the PDU session reactivation result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message indicating that userplane resources for the corresponding PDU session cannot be reestablished and

if timer T3540 is not started see subclause 5.3.1.3 item f and the UE did not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message during the service request procedure the UE may initiate a registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update. If timer T3540 is started and the UE does not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message before the established N1 NAS signalling connection is released by the network or timer T3540 expires or is stopped as specified in subclause 5.3.1.3 the UE may initiate the registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update upon release of the N1 NAS signalling connection and
if the AMF has SNSSAI location validity information that is applicable to the current cell of the UE and was not yet provided to the UE before sending the SERVICE ACCEPT message the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure and include the SNSSAI location validity information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the PDU session reactivation result IE is included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message indicating that the userplane resources cannot be established for a PDU session that was indicated by the UE in the Allowed PDU session status IE as allowed to be reestablished over 3GPP access the UE considers the corresponding PDU session to be associated with the non3GPP access.

if timer T3540 is not started see subclause 5.3.1.3 item f and the UE did not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message during the service request procedure the UE may initiate a registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update. If timer T3540 is started and the UE does not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message before the established N1 NAS signalling connection is released by the network or timer T3540 expires or is stopped as specified in subclause 5.3.1.3 the UE may initiate the registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update upon release of the N1 NAS signalling connection.
if the AMF has SNSSAI locaion validity information that is applicable to the current cell of the UE and was not yet provided to the UE before sending the SERVICE ACCEPT message the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure and include the SNSSAI location validity information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the PDU session reactivation result IE is included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message indicating that the userplane resources cannot be established for a PDU session that was indicated by the UE in the Allowed PDU session status IE as allowed to be reestablished over 3GPP access the UE considers the corresponding PDU session to be associated with the non3GPP access.
For case d in subclause 5.6.1.1 the UE shall also treat the indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been released as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter stop the timer T3517 and enter the state 5GMMREGISTERED.

if the DDX field of the Release assistance indication IE or the DDX field of the CIoT small data container IE is set to No further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected in the message
if the AMF decides to forward the uplink data piggybacked in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and
if the AMF decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane
then the AMF shall send SERVICE ACCEPT message with the T3448 value IE included.
If the AMF decides to deactivate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane then the AMF shall delete the stored control plane data backoff time for the UE and the AMF shall not include timer T3448 value IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message.
If the T3448 value IE is present in the received SERVICE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated the UE shall
a stop timer T3448 if it is running
b consider the transport of user data via the control plane as successful and
c start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.
If the UE is using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization the T3448 value IE is present in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated the UE shall ignore the T3448 value IE and proceed as if the T3448 value IE was not present.
If the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode initiated the service request procedure by sending a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the SERVICE ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running then the UE shall stop timer T3448.
For case h in subclause 5.6.1.1

c the AMF shall not check for CAG restrictions.
If the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message is for emergency services fallback the AMF triggers the emergency services fallback procedure as specified in subclause 4.13.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 .
##### 5.6.1.5	Service request procedure not accepted by the network
If the service request cannot be accepted the network shall return a SERVICE REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.
If the SERVICE REJECT message with 5GMM cause #76 or #78 was received without integrity protection then the UE shall discard the message.
If the AMF needs to initiate PDU session status synchronisation or a PDU session status IE was included in the SERVICE REQUEST message the AMF shall include a PDU session status IE in the SERVICE REJECT message to indicate which PDU sessions associated with the access type the SERVICE REJECT message is sent over are active in the AMF. If the PDU session status IE is included in the SERVICE REJECT message and if the message is integrity protected then
a for single access PDU sessions the UE shall perform a local release of all those PDU sessions which are not in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE or PDU SESSION ACTIVE PENDING on the UE side associated with the access type the SERVICE REJECT message is sent over but are indicated by the AMF as being in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE. If a locally released PDU session is associated with one or more MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions and
b for MA PDU sessions for all those PDU sessions which are not in 5GSM state PDU SESSION INACTIVE or PDU SESSION ACTIVE PENDING and have user plane resources established on the UE side associated with the access the SERVICE REJECT message is sent over but are indicated by the AMF as no user plane resources established
1 for MA PDU sessions having user plane resources established only on the access type the SERVICE REJECT message is sent over the UE shall perform a local release of those MA PDU sessions. If a locally released PDU session is associated with one or more MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions and
2 for MA PDU sessions having user plane resources established on both accesses the UE shall perform a local release on the user plane resources on the access type the SERVICE REJECT message is sent over. If a locally released PDU session is associated with one or more MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions.
If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control for the SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 the network may set an appropriate cause value other than 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and does not assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
In NBN1 mode if the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to operator determined barring see 3GPP TS 29.503 20AB the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for backoff timer T3346.
If the service request from a UE supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only and should include the CAG information list in the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the SERVICE REJECT message.
NOTE 1 The network cannot be certain that CAG information list stored in the UE is updated as result of sending of the SERVICE REJECT message with the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE as the SERVICE REJECT message is not necessarily delivered to the UE e.g. due to abnormal radio conditions.
NOTE 2 The CAG information list can be provided by the AMF and include no entry if no CAG information list exists in the subscription.
NOTE 2A If the UE supports extended CAG information list the CAG information list can be included either in the CAG information list IE or Extended CAG information list IE.
NOTE 2B It is unexpected for network to send REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE with 5GMM cause value #76 in nonCAG cell and not indicate Indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the serving PLMN in the Extended CAG information list or the CAG information list.
If the UE does not support extended CAG information list the CAG information list shall not be included in the Extended CAG information list IE.
If the service request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall operate as described in bullet h of subclause 5.6.1.8.
Upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with uplink data
if the AMF decides to not forward the uplink data piggybacked in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and
if the AMF decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane
then the AMF shall send a SERVICE REJECT message and set the 5GMM cause value to #22 congestion and assign a value for control plane data backoff timer T3448.
If the AMF determines that the UE is in a nonallowed area or is not in an allowed area as specified in subclause 5.3.5 then
a if the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message is set to signalling or data the AMF shall send a SERVICE REJECT message with the 5GMM cause value set to #28 Restricted service area
b otherwise if the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message is set to mobile terminated services emergency services emergency services fallback high priority access or elevated signalling the AMF shall continue the process as specified in subclause 5.6.1.4 unless for other reasons the service request cannot be accepted.
If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to service gap control as specified in subclause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running in AMF the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #22 Congestion and may include T3346 value IE in the SERVICE REJECT message set to the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.
Based on operator policy if the service request procedure is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #31 Redirection to EPC required.
NOTE 3 The network can take into account the UEs S1 mode capability the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the EPC to determine the rejection with the 5GMM cause value #31 Redirection to EPC required.
If the service request is via a satellite NGRAN cell and the network determines that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate see 3GPP TS 23.502 the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message to #78 PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location.
NOTE 3A While location determination is ongoing to ensure that operator and regulatory policies are met the AMF can perform DNNbased or SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclauses 5.3.10 and 5.3.11 to prevent the UE from accessing network.
If the service request from a UE supporting MINT is rejected due to a disaster condition no longer being applicable in the current location of the UE the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #11 PLMN not allowed or #13 Roaming not allowed in this tracking area and may include a disaster return wait range in the Disaster return wait range IE in the SERVICE REJECT message.
On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message if the UE is in state 5GMMSERVICEREQUESTINITIATED the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter and stop timer T3517 if running.

a the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE or
b the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service IE or
c both
in the SERVICE REJECT message.
Regardless of the 5GMM cause value received in the SERVICE REJECT message via satellite NGRAN
if the UE receives the Forbidden TAIs for the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming IE in the SERVICE REJECT message the UE shall store the TAIs belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs and ignore the TAIs which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMNs included in the IE if not already stored into the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming and

1 SERVICE REQUEST message and the service type of the SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to emergency services fallback or
2 CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to emergency services fallback
then the 5GMM sublayer shall increment the service request attempt counter abort the procedure and release locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The service request attempt counter shall not be incremented if
1 the service request procedure is initiated to establish an emergency PDU session
2 the UE has an emergency PDU session established
3 the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN
4 the service request procedure is initiated in response to paging or notification from the network or
5 the UE in NBN1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 .
If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5 the UE shall start timer T3525. Additionally if the service request procedure was initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call or for an MO MMTEL video call or for an MO IMS registration related signalling a notification that the service request was not initiated due to the UE having started timer T3525 shall be provided to the upper layers.
NOTE 1 This can result in the upper layers requesting implementation specific mechanisms e.g. the MMTEL voice call being attempted to another IPCAN or establishment of a CS voice call if supported and not already attempted in the CS domain.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in 5GMMCONNECTED mode sending a
1 SERVICE REQUEST message and the service type of the SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to emergency services fallback or
2 CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to emergency services fallback
the 5GMM sublayer shall abort the procedure and stay in 5GMMCONNECTED mode.
If the service type of the SERVICE REQUEST message was set to emergency services fallback or the control plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was set to emergency services fallback and
1 the service request procedure was triggered in 5GMMIDLE mode the 5GMM sublayer shall abort the procedure release locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure or
2 the service request procedure was triggered in 5GMMCONNECTED mode the 5GMM sublayer shall abort the procedure stay in 5GMMCONNECTED mode.
b The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred.
The UE shall not start the service request procedure. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Receipt of the access barred indication shall not trigger the selection of a different core network type EPC or 5GCN.
The service request procedure is started if still needed when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated.
ba The lower layers indicate that
1 access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0 and 2 or
2 access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0.
If the SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST has not been sent the UE shall proceed as specified for case b.
If the SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST has been sent
1 the UE shall abort the service request procedure and stop timer T3517. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process and
2 the service request procedure is started if still needed when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated.
For additional UE requirements for both cases see subclause 4.5.5.

3 the UE in NBN1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP TS 31.102 or
4 the UE is initiating the service request procedure to request emergency services or emergency services fallback.
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure is started if still necessary when timer T3448 expires.
n Access for localized services in current SNPN is no longer allowed.
If the service request procedure is not to request emergency services and there is no PDU session for emergency services the registered SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN see 3GPP TS 23.122 and
access for localized services in SNPN is disabled or
the validity information for the selected SNPN is no longer met
then the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter stop T3517 abort the service request procedure locally release the NAS signalling connection if any and enter state 5GMMREGISTERED.LIMITEDSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.PLMNSEARCH in order to perform SNPN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 .
##### 5.6.1.8	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Lower layer failure.
If a lower layer failure occurs before a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent to the UE or the service request procedure has been completed by the AMF the AMF entersstays in 5GMMIDLE.
b Protocol error.
If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message is received with a protocol error the AMF shall return a SERVICE REJECT message with one of the following 5GMM cause values
#111	protocol error, unspecified.
The AMF stays in the current 5GMM mode.
c More than one SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message received before the procedure has been completed i.e. before SERVICE REJECT message has been sent or service request procedure has been completed.
If one or more of the information elements in the SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message differs from the ones received within the previous SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message the previously initiated service request procedure shall be aborted and the new service request procedure shall be progressed
If the information elements do not differ then the AMF shall continue with the previous service request procedure and shall not treat any further this SERVICE REQUEST message or this CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.
d REGISTRATION REQUEST message received with initial registration or emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE before a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent or the service request procedure has been completed.
If a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with initial registration or emergency registration in the 5GS registration type IE is received and the service request procedure has not been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent the AMF may initiate the 5GMM common procedures e.g. the primary authentication and key agreement procedure. The AMF may e.g. after a successful primary authentication and key agreement procedure execution abort the service request procedure delete the 5GMM context indicate towards the SMF that the 5GMM context has been deleted and progress the new REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
e REGISTRATION REQUEST message received with mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating in the 5GS registration type IE received before the service request procedure has been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent.
If a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with mobility registration updating or periodic registration updating in the 5GS registration type IE is received and the service request procedure has not been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has not been sent the AMF may initiate the 5GMM common procedures e.g. the primary authentication and key agreement procedure. The AMF may e.g. after a successful primary authentication and key agreement procedure execution abort the service request procedure and progress the new REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
f If a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating mobile originating request is received after the AMF initiated a paging procedure the AMF shall treat this CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST as a paging response and handle the message according to subclauses 5.6.1.4 and 5.6.1.5.
g CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message received with the Data type field indicates control plane user data in the CIoT small data container IE or received with Payload container type IE set to CIoT user data container and
1 the AMF does not have a PDU session routing context for the PDU session ID and the UE or
2 the AMF unsuccessfully attempted to forward the user data container and the PDU session ID
then the AMF may send back to the UE the CIoT user data container or control plane user data which was not forwarded as specified in subclause 5.4.5.3.1 case l1 or case l2.
h Based on operator policy if the service request from a UE not supporting CAG is rejected due to CAG restrictions the network shall reject the service request with a 5GMM cause value other than the 5GMM cause #76 Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only.
NOTE 5GMM cause #7 5GS services not allowed 5GMM cause #11 PLMN not allowed 5GMM cause #27 N1 mode not allowed 5GMM cause #73 Serving network not authorized can be used depending on the subscription of the UE and whether the UE roams or not.
i CIoT user data received for a PDU session ID which is inactive in the network.
If a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message is received with CIoT user data for a PDU session that is inactive in the network the AMF shall discard the CIoT user data. The AMF shall send the SERVICE ACCEPT message and indicate that this PDU session ID is inactive using the PDU session status IE.
##### 5.6.2.1	General
The paging procedure is performed only in 3GPP access and used by the network to request the establishment of a NAS signalling connection to the UE. The paging procedure is also used by the network to request the UE to reestablish the userplane resources of PDU sessions for downlink user data transport. Another purpose of the paging procedure is to request the UE to reestablish the userplane resources of PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access over 3GPP access.
Additionally the network can use the paging procedure to initiate the mobile terminating SMS.
For the UE using eDRX the network initiates the paging procedure when NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE within the paging time window and requests the lower layers to include the eDRX cycle length and paging time window length in the paging message. If NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE outside the paging time window and the eDRX value that the network provides to the UE in the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure indicates
a the eDRX cycle length duration of the EUTRA cell connected to 5GCN is higher than 5.12 seconds or
b the eDRX cycle length duration of the NR cell connected to 5GCN is higher than 10.24 seconds
the network initiates the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning of the next paging time window.
NOTE T time is a short time period based on implementation. The operator can take possible imperfections in the synchronization between the 5GCN and the UE into account when choosing T time.
If the network detects that the pending user data to be sent to the UE is related to the voice service as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 and the network decides to initiate the paging procedure based on the stored paging restriction information if any the AMF should request the lower layer to include the Voice Service Indication in the paging message when the UE and the network support the paging indication for voice services.
###### 5.6.2.2.1	General
The network shall initiate the paging procedure for 5GS services when NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE in 5GMMIDLE mode over 3GPP access see example in figure 5.6.2.2.1.1 and there is no paging restriction applied in the network for that paging.
Figure 5.6.2.2.1.1 Paging procedure
To initiate the procedure the 5GMM entity in the AMF requests the lower layer to start paging and shall start timer T3513.
If downlink signalling or user data is pending to be sent over non3GPP access the 5GMM entity in the AMF shall indicate to the lower layer that the paging is associated to non3GPP access.
The network shall not page the UE to reestablish userplane resources of PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access over 3GPP access if all the PDU sessions of the UE that are established over the 3GPP access are associated with control plane only indication or SNSSAIs associated with PDU sessions are not in the UE’s allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI for a PLMN on 3GPP access.
If the network has downlink user data pending for a UE the AMF has stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in the stored paging restriction is set to
a All paging is restricted the network should not page the UE
b All paging is restricted except for voice service the network should page the UE only when
1 the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice service related by the network
c All paging is restricted except for specified PDU sessions the network should page the UE only when
1 for PDU sessions that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction the network has downlink user data pending or
d All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDU sessions the network should page the UE only when
1 the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice service related by the network or
2 for PDU sessions that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction the network has downlink user data pending.
If the network has downlink signalling pending for a UE and the AMF has stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in the stored paging restriction is set to
a All paging is restricted the network should not page the UE
b All paging is restricted except for voice service the network should page the UE only when
1 the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling or 5GSM signalling of the PDU session of voice service
c All paging is restricted except for specified PDU sessions the network should page the UE only when
1 the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling or
2 for PDU sessions that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction the network has downlink 5GSM signalling pending or
d All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDU sessions the network should page the UE only when
1 the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling or 5GSM signalling of the PDU session of voice service or
2 for PDU sessions that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction the network has downlink 5GSM signalling pending.
NOTE 1 If the network pages the UE due to downlink signalling pending the network initiates the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection after networkrequested procedure is completed.
The 5GMM entity in the AMF may provide the lower layer with the allowed CAG list and an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the current PLMN if available and with the allowed CAG list and an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells per equivalent PLMN if available. If there is an active emergency PDU session the 5GMM entity in the AMF shall not provide the lower layer with the allowed CAG list and an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells for the current PLMN even if available or with the allowed CAG list and an indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells per equivalent PLMN even if available.
Upon reception of a paging indication the UE shall stop the timer T3346 if running and
a if control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is not used by the UE the UE shall
1 initiate a service request procedure over 3GPP access to respond to the paging as specified in subclauses 5.6.1.2.1 if the UE is in 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE or 5GMMREGISTERED.NONALLOWEDSERVICE as described in subclause 5.3.5.2 state and the UE is in the 5GMMIDLE mode without suspend indication
2 initiate a service request procedure over non3GPP access to respond to the paging as specified in subclauses 5.6.1
3 initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update over 3GPP access to respond to the paging as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.3.2 or
4 proceed as specified in subclause 5.3.1.5 if the UE is in the 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication or
b if control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is used by the UE the UE shall
1 initiate a service request procedure as specified in subclause 5.6.1.2.2 if the UE is in the 5GMMIDLE mode without suspend indication
2 initiate a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update over 3GPP access as specified in subclauses 5.5.1.3.2 or
3 proceed as specified in subclause 5.3.1.5 if the UE is in the 5GMMIDLE mode with suspend indication.
NOTE 2 If the UE is in the 5GMMIDLE mode without suspend indication and has an uplink user data to be sent to the network using control plane CIoT 5GS optimization when receiving the paging indication the UE can piggyback the uplink user data during the service request procedure initiated to respond to the paging as specified in subclause 5.6.1.2.2.
The MUSIM UE based on implementation may use the paging cause indicated by lower layers see 3GPP TS 38.331 if any to accept the paging reject the paging or ignore the paging indication.
Upon reception of a paging indication if the network supports the rejection of paging request and if a MUSIM UE decides not to accept the paging the UE may initiate a service request procedure to reject the paging as specified in subclause 5.6.1.1.
NOTE 3 As an implementation option MUSIM UE is allowed to not respond to paging based on the information available in the paging message e.g. voice service indication.
If TMGI is used as paging identity and the TMGI matches with multicast MBS session which the has UE joined the UE shall respond to the paging. Otherwise the UE shall not respond to the paging.
The network shall stop timer T3513 for the paging procedure when an integrityprotected response is received from the UE and successfully integrity checked by the network or when the 5GMM entity in the AMF receives an indication from the lower layer that it has received the NGAP UE context resume request message as specified in 3GPP TS 38.413 . If the response received is not integrity protected or the integrity check is unsuccessful timer T3513 for the paging procedure shall be kept running unless
a the UE is registered for emergency services
b the UE has an emergency PDU session or
c the response received is a REGISTRATION REQUEST message for mobility and periodic registration update and the security mode control procedure or authentication procedure performed during mobility and periodic registration update has completed successfully.
Upon expiry of timer T3513 the network may reinitiate paging.
If the network while waiting for a response to the paging sent without paging priority receives downlink signalling or downlink data associated with priority userplane resources for PDU sessions or receives an MT SMS over NAS with priority for messaging as specified in 3GPP TS 29.503 20AB and is allowed by local policy the network shall stop timer T3513 and then initiate the paging procedure with paging priority.
###### 5.6.2.2.2	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal case can be identified
a Void.
###### 5.6.2.2.3	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified

The UE shall not respond to paging message.
b Paging message received with access type set to 3GPP access when UEinitiated 5GMM specific procedure or service request procedure is ongoing.
The UE shall proceed with 5GMM specific procedure or service request procedure. If for registration procedure and service requestprocedure lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred then the UE shall handle the pending paging message as specified in subclause 5.6.2.2.1. Otherwise the UE shall ignore the paging once lower layers confirm the establishment of the signalling connection.

#### 6.1.1	General
This clause describes the procedures used for 5GS session management 5GSM performed over an N1 NAS signalling connection.
The main function of the 5GSM sublayer is to support the PDU session handling in the UE and in the SMF transferred via the AMF.
The 5GSM comprises procedures for
the authentication and authorization establishment modification and release of PDU sessions and
request for performing handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access or to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS.
Each PDU session represents a PDU session established between the UE and an SMF. PDU sessions can remain established even if the radio and network resources constituting the corresponding PDU session between the UE and the SMF are temporarily released.
5GSM procedures can be performed only if a 5GMM context has been established between the UE and the AMF and the secure exchange of NAS messages has been initiated by the AMF by use of the 5GMM procedures described in clause 5. Once the UE is successfully registered to a PLMN a PDU session can be established. If no 5GMM context has been established the 5GMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a 5GMM context by use of the 5GMM procedures as described in clause 5.
The UE can request the network to modify or release PDU sessions. The network can fulfil such a request from the UE by modifying a PDU session or releasing a PDU session using networkrequested procedures see subclause 6.3.
#### 6.1.2	Types of 5GSM procedures
Three types of 5GSM procedures can be distinguished
a Procedures related to PDU sessions
These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for authentication and authorization or manipulation of PDU sessions
1 PDU authentication and authorization
2 networkrequested PDU session modification
3 networkrequested PDU session release and
4 servicelevel authentication and authorization.
This procedure is initiated by the UE and to request for establishment of PDU sessions or to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access or to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS
UErequested PDU session establishment.
b Transaction related procedures
These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for handling of PDU sessions i.e. to modify a PDU session or to release a PDU session
1 UErequested PDU session modification and
2 UErequested PDU session release.
This procedure is initiated by the 5G ProSe UEtonetwork relay UE and is used for the manipulation of PDU sessions
remote UE report.
A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers the network to execute one of the following procedures related to PDU session networkrequested PDU session modification procedure or networkrequested PDU session release procedure. The UE treats the start of the procedure related to the PDU session as completion of the transaction related procedure.
c Common procedure
The following 5GSM procedure can be related to a PDU session or to a procedure transaction
5GSM status procedure.
##### 6.1.3.1	General
In the following subclauses the possible states of a PDU session in the UE and the network side are described.

##### 6.1.4.1	Coordination between 5GSM and ESM with N26 interface
Interworking with EPS is supported for a PDU session if the PDU session includes the mapped EPS bearer contexts or has associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer after intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode. The SMF shall not include any mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with a PDU session for LADN with a PDU session which is a multihomed IPv6 PDU session and with a PDU session with the selected SSC mode set to SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3. If the UE receives any mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session for LADN for a multihomed IPv6 PDU session or for a PDU session with the selected SSC mode set to SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3 the UE may locally delete the mapped EPS bearer context. See coding of the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE in subclause 9.11.4.8. In an MA PDU session the UE shall have one set of the mapped EPS bearer contexts. The network can provide the set of the mapped EPS bearer contexts of the MA PDU session via either access of the MA PDU session. In an MA PDU session the UE shall support modification or deletion via an access of a mapped EPS bearer context of the MA PDU session created via the same or the other access.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall create the default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer contexts based on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session if available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer in the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access
a the PDU session is not an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall perform a local release of the PDU session or
b the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall perform a local release of the PDU session over 3GPP access and consider that the MA PDU session is established over non3GPP access only.
If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flows of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access which is not associated with the default QoS rule or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the nondefault QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access unless the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access and over non3GPP access the UE shall locally delete the QoS rules and the QoS flow descriptions. The UE uses the parameters from each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated EPS bearer contexts as follows
a the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context as follows
1 the PDN type shall be set to nonIP if the PDU session type is Unstructured
2 the PDN type shall be set to IPv4 if the PDU session type is IPv4
3 the PDN type shall be set to IPv6 if the PDU session type is IPv6
4 the PDN type shall be set to IPv4v6 if the PDU session type is IPv4v6
5 the PDN type shall be set to nonIP if the PDU session type is Ethernet and the UE the network or both of them do not support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode and
6 the PDN type shall be set to Ethernet if the PDU session type is Ethernet and the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode
b the PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context as follows
1 the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU address of the PDU session if the PDU session type is IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 and
2 the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero if the PDU session type is Ethernet or Unstructured
c the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default EPS bearer context unless the PDU session is an emergency PDU session
d the APNAMBR and extended APNAMBR received in the parameters of the default EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be mapped to the APNAMBR and extended APNAMBR of the default EPS bearer context
e for each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE PDU SESSION MODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING
1 if the UE is performing an intersystem change from N1 mode to WBS1 mode the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer contexts to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or
2 if the UE is performing an intersystem change from N1 mode to NBS1 mode for the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to the default EPS bearer the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. Additionally if the UE is performing an intersystem change from WBN1 mode to NBS1 mode for the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to a dedicated EPS bearer if any the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and
f for any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer contexts to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.
Additionally for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session
a the EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity received in the mapped EPS bearer context or the EPS bearer identity associated with the QoS flow
b the EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context or the EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow
c the extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow and
d the traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow template of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context or the stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow if available.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall associate the PDU session identity the SNSSAI and the sessionAMBR with the default EPS bearer context and for each EPS bearer context mapped from one or more QoS flows associate the QoS rules for the QoS flows and the QoS flow descriptions for the QoS flows with the EPS bearer context.
If the PDU session is associated with the control plane only indication and supports interworking with EPS after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall associate the EPS bearer contexts of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the control plane only indication.
If the PDU session is associated with a PDU session pair ID after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the PDU session pair ID. If the PDU session is associated with an RSN after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the RSN.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode if
a the UE sent the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator and received the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator in the PDU session or
b the PDU session is associated with the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators
the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE and the SMF shall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE supports nonIP PDN type and the PDU session type is Ethernet or Unstructured.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE and the SMF shall maintain the following 5GSM attributions and capabilities associated with the PDU session until the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released
a the alwayson PDU session indication
b the maximum number of supported packet filters
c the support of reflective QoS
d the maximum data rate per UE for userplane integrity protection supported by the UE for uplink and the maximum data rate per UE for userplane integrity protection supported by the UE for downlink
e the support of multihomed IPv6 PDU session and
f if the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access the PDN connection of the default EPS bearer corresponding to the MA PDU session shall be considered as a userplane resource of the MA PDU session.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface shall deem that the following features are supported by the network on the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session
a PS data off and
b Local address in TFT.
If there is a QoS flow used for IMS signalling after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the EPS bearer associated with the QoS flow for IMS signalling becomes the EPS bearer for IMS signalling.
When the UE is provided with a new sessionAMBR in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall discard the corresponding association and associate the new valuewith the default EPS bearer context.
The network may provide the UE with one or more QoS rules by including either one QoS rules parameter or one QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter but not both in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. The network may provide the UE with one or more QoS flow descriptions corresponding to the EPS bearer context being modified by including either one QoS flow descriptions parameter or one QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter but not both in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
When the UE is provided with one or more QoS flow descriptions or the EPS bearer identity of an existing QoS flow description is modified in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall check the EPS bearer identity included in the QoS flow description and
a if the EPS bearer identity corresponds to the EPS bearer context being modified or the EPS bearer identity is not included the UE shall store the QoS flow description and all the associated QoS rules if any for the EPS bearer context being modified for use during intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode and
b otherwise the UE shall locally delete the QoS flow description and all the associated QoS rules if any and include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
When the UE is provided with one or more QoS rules or one or more QoS flow descriptions in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall process the QoS rules sequentially starting with the first QoS rule and shall process the QoS flow descriptions sequentially starting with the first QoS flow description. The UE shall check the QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions for different types of errors as follows
NOTE 1 If an error is detected in a QoS rule or a QoS flow description which requires sending a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause value then the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter included in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are discarded if any.
NOTE 2 If the EPS bearer context modification procedure is rejected then the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter included in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are discarded if any.

b Syntactical errors in QoS operations
1 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters the packet filter list in the QoS rule is empty and the QoS rule is provided for a PDN connection of PDN type IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet or for a PDN connection of PDN type nonIP and there is locally available information associated with the PDN connection that is set to Ethernet.
2 When the rule operation is Delete existing QoS rule or Modify existing QoS rule without modifying packet filters with a nonempty packet filter list in the QoS rule.
3 When the rule operation is Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters and the packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original QoS rule.
4 Void.
5 When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter or the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list when the rule operation is delete existing QoS rule or create new QoS rule or the number of packet filters subfield is larger than the maximum possible number of packet filters in the packet filter list i.e. there is no QoS rule precedence subfield included in the QoS rule IE the QoS Rule Identifier is set to no QoS rule identifier assigned when the rule operation is not delete existing QoS rule or the QoS flow identifier is set to no QoS flow identifier assigned when the flow description operation is not Delete existing QoS flow description.
6 When the
A rule operation is Create new QoS rule Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule without modifying packet filters the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 and there is no QoS flow description with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the resulting QoS rule.
B flow description operation is Delete existing QoS flow description and the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the QoS flow description that is deleted i.e. there is no associated QoS flow description with the same QFI.
7 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description or Modify existing QoS flow description and the UE determines that there is a QoS flow description of a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 which lacks at least one of the mandatory parameters i.e. GFBR uplink GFBR downlink MFBR uplink and MFBR downlink. If the QoS flow description does not include a 5QI the UE determines this by using the QFI as the 5QI.
8 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters with a nonempty packet filter list in the QoS rule and the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the QoS rule is provided for a PDN connection of PDN type nonIP and there is locally available information associated with the PDN connection that is set to Unstructured.
In case 3 the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the deletion request and if no error according to items c and d was detected consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.
Otherwise the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
NOTE 3 It is not considered an error if the UE determines that after processing all QoS operations on QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions there is a QoS flow description that is not associated with any QoS rule and the UE is not in NBN1 mode.
NOTE 3a An implementation that strictly follows QoS rule operation as defined in subclause 9.11.4.13 might not detect case 2.
c Semantic errors in packet filters
1 When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.
The UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #44 semantic errors in packet filters in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
d Syntactical errors in packet filters
1 When the rule operation is Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters and two or more packet filters in the resultant QoS rule would have identical packet filter identifiers.
2 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and two or more packet filters in the resultant QoS rule would have identical packet filter identifiers.
3 When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier.
4 Void.
In case 1 if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #45 syntactical error in packet filters in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message. Otherwise the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and if it was processed successfully delete the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter identifiers.
Otherwise the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #45 syntactical error in packet filters in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
If the UE detects different errors in the QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions as described in this subclause which requires sending a 5GSM cause parameter in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message the UE shall include a single 5GSM cause parameter in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
NOTE 4 The 5GSM cause to use cannot be different from #44 semantic error in packet filters #45 syntactical errors in packet filters #83 semantic error in the QoS operation or #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation. The selection of a 5GSM cause is up to UE implementation.
Upon successful completion of an EPS attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode see 3GPP TS 24.301 unless the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access and over non3GPP access both connected to 5GCN
a the UE shall delete any UE derived QoS rules of each PDU session which has been transferred to EPS
b the UE and the SMF shall perform a local release of the PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access which have not been transferred to EPS and
c the UE and the SMF shall perform a local release of QoS flows which have not been transferred to EPS of the PDU sessions which have been transferred to EPS. The UE and the SMF shall also perform a local release of any QoS flow description not associated with any QoS rule and not associated with any mapped EPS bearer context. If there is a QoS flow description not associated with any QoS rule but associated with a mapped EPS bearer context and after the intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the respective EPS bearer context is active then the UE shall associate the QoS flow description with the EPS bearer context.
For PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access in 5GS if present the UE may
a keep some or all of these PDU sessions still associated with non3GPP access in 5GS if supported
b release some or all of these PDU sessions explicitly by initiating the UE requested PDU session release procedures or
c attempt to transfer some or all of these PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the UE requested PDN connectivity procedures with the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message created as follows

3 the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default EPS bearer context unless the PDN connection is an emergency PDN connection and
4 the PDU session ID parameter in the Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE shall be set to the PDU session identity of the PDU session.
If a PDU session associated with non3GPP access is transferred to EPS the UE shall associate the PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context and shall delete any UE derived QoS rules of such PDU session.
Interworking to 5GS is supported for a PDN connection if the corresponding default EPS bearer context includes a PDU session identity an SNSSAI if the PDN connection is a nonemergency PDN connection session AMBR and one or more QoS flow descriptions received in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE see 3GPP TS 24.301 or the default EPS bearer context has association with the PDU session identity the SNSSAI if the PDU session is a nonemergency PDU session the sessionAMBR and one or more QoS flow descriptions after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode.
For a PDN connection established in S1 mode to enable the UE to attempt to transfer the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode in case of intersystem change the UE shall allocate a PDU session identity indicate the allocated PDU session identity in the PDU session ID parameter in the Protocol configuration options IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and associate the allocated PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection. If an N5CW device supporting 3GPP access establishes a new PDN connection in S1 mode the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access shall refrain from allocating PDU session identity value 15.
For a PDN connection established in S1 mode the SMF assigning the QoS rules shall consider that the UE supports 16 packet filters for the corresponding PDU session until the UE indicates a higher number as specified in subclause 6.4.2.2.
The network may provide the UE with one or more QoS rules by including either one QoS rules parameter or one QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter but not both in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. The network may provide the UE with one or more QoS flow descriptions corresponding to the EPS bearer context being activated by including either one QoS flow descriptions parameter or one QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter but not both in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
When the UE is provided with one or more QoS flow descriptions in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall check the EPS bearer identity included in the QoS flow description and
a if the EPS bearer identity corresponds to the EPS bearer context being activated or the EPS bearer identity is not included the UE shall store the QoS flow description and all the associated QoS rules if any for the EPS bearer context being activated for use during intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode and
b otherwise the UE shall locally delete the QoS flow description and all the associated QoS rules if any and include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
When the UE is provided with one or more QoS rules or one or more QoS flow descriptions in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the UE shall process the QoS rules sequentially starting with the first QoS rule and shall process the QoS flow descriptions sequentially starting with the first QoS flow description. The UE shall check QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions for different types of errors as follows
NOTE 5 If an error is detected in a QoS rule or a QoS flow description which requires sending a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause value then the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter included in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are discarded if any.
NOTE 6 If the default EPS bearer context activation procedure or the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is rejected then the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter and the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter included in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message are discarded if any.
a Semantic errors in QoS operations
1 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule when theres already a default QoS rule.
2 When the rule operation is received in an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and there is no rule with the DQR bit set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule.
3 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and two or more QoS rules associated with this PDU session would have identical precedence values.
4 When the rule operation is an operation other than Create new QoS rule.
5 When the flow description operation is an operation other than Create new QoS flow description.
6 When the UE determines that
i the default EPS bearer context is associated with one or more QoS flows but the default EPS bearer context is not associated with the default QoS rules.
ii a dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with one or more QoS flows but the dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with the default QoS rule.
7 When the flow description operation is received in an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description and there is already an existing QoS flow description with the same QoS flow identifier stored for an EPS bearer context different from the EPS bearer context being activated and belonging to the same PDN connection as the EPS bearer context being activated.
8 When the rule operation is received in an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and there is already an existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier stored for an EPS bearer context different from the EPS bearer context being activated and belonging to the same PDN connection as the EPS bearer context being activated.
9 When the rule operation is received in an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and the resultant QoS rule is associated with a QoS flow description stored for an EPS bearer context different from the EPS bearer context being activated and belonging to the same PDN connection as the EPS bearer context being activated.
10 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and one matchall packet filter is to be associated with the QoS rule.
11 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description and there is already an existing QoS flow description with the same QoS flow identifier stored for the EPS bearer context being activated.
12 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and there is already an existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier and the existing QoS rule is associated with a QoS flow description stored for the EPS bearer context being activated or the existing QoS rule is not associated with any QoS flow description.
In case 4 if the rule operation is for a nondefault QoS rule the UE shall delete the QoS rule. If the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #83 semantic error in the QoS operation in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
In case 11 the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the create request and if it was processed successfully delete the old QoS flow description i.e. the QoS flow description that existed when case 11 was detected.
In case 12 if the existing QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and the DQR bit of the new QoS rule is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the create request and if it was processed successfully delete the old QoS rule i.e. the QoS rule that existed when case 12 was detected. If the existing QoS rule is the default QoS rule or the DQR bit of the new QoS rule is set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #83 semantic error in the QoS operation in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
Otherwise for all the cases above the UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #83 semantic error in the QoS operation in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
b Syntactical errors in QoS operations
1 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule the packet filter list in the QoS rule is empty and the QoS rule is provided for a PDN connection of PDN type IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet or for a PDN connection of PDN type nonIP and there is locally available information associated with the PDN connection that is set to Ethernet.
2 Void.
3 When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the QoS rules parameter the QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter the QoS flow descriptions parameter or the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets parameter such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list when the rule operation is delete existing QoS rule or create new QoS rule or the number of packet filters subfield is larger than the maximum possible number of packet filters in the packet filter list i.e. there is no QoS rule precedence subfield included in the QoS rule IE the QoS Rule Identifier is set to no QoS rule identifier assigned or the QoS flow identifier is set to no QoS flow identifier assigned.
4 When the
A rule operation is Create new QoS rule the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 and there is no QoS flow description with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the resulting QoS rule.
5 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description and the UE determines that there is a QoS flow description of a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 which lacks at least one of the mandatory parameters i.e. GFBR uplink GFBR downlink MFBR uplink and MFBR downlink. If the QoS flow description does not include a 5QI the UE determines this by using the QFI as the 5QI.
The UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
NOTE 7 It is not considered an error if the UE determines that after processing all QoS operations on QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions there is a QoS flow description that is not associated with any QoS rule and the UE is not in NBN1 mode.
c Semantic errors in packet filters
1 When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.
The UE shall include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #44 semantic errors in packet filters in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
d Syntactical errors in packet filters
1 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and two or more packet filters in the resultant QoS rule would have identical packet filter identifiers.
2 When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier.
The UE shall delete the QoS rule and include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE with a 5GSM cause parameter set to 5GSM cause #45 syntactical error in packet filters in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
If the UE detects different errors in the QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions as described in this subclause which requires sending a 5GSM cause parameter in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message the UE shall include a single 5GSM cause parameter in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
NOTE 8 The 5GSM cause to use cannot be different from #44 semantic error in packet filters #45 syntactical errors in packet filters #83 semantic error in the QoS operation or #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation. The selection of a 5GSM cause is up to UE implementation.
Upon intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE uses the parameters from the default EPS bearer context of each PDN connection for which interworking to 5GS is supported to create a corresponding PDU session associated with 3GPP access as follows unless the PDN connection is a userplane resource of an MA PDU session

d for each default EPS bearer context in state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE the UE shall set the state of the mapped PDU session to PDU SESSION ACTIVE and
e for any other default EPS bearer context the UE shall set the state of the mapped PDU session to PDU SESSION INACTIVE.
Additionally the UE shall set
a the PDU session identity of the PDU session to the PDU session identity included by the UE in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or the PDU session identity associated with the default EPS bearer context
b the SNSSAI of the PDU session to the SNSSAI included by the network in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message or the SNSSAI associated with the default EPS bearer context if the PDN connection is a nonemergency PDN connection

NOTE 9 For a QoS rule which does not exist over non3GPP access the UE does not create the QoS rule if the QoS rule is the default QoS rule or the precedence value of the QoS rule equals to the precedence value of a QoS rule exists over the non3GPP access.
Additionally for each PDU session which was created at intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode from a corresponding PDN connection of the Ethernet PDN type the UE shall consider that Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode is supported by the network and the SMF shall consider that Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode is supported by the UE.
The UE and the network shall locally release the PDN connections and EPS bearer contexts associated with the 3GPP access which have not been transferred to 5GS.
After intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode for each QoS flow mapped from an EPS bearer context the UE shall associate the EPS bearer identity the EPS QoS parameters the extended EPS QoS parameters and the traffic flow template if available of the EPS bearer context with the QoS flow.
After intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode for each QoS flow of an MA PDU session which

If the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection is associated with the PDU session pair ID and the PDN connection supports interworking to 5GS after intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE shall associate the PDU session corresponding to the PDN connection with the PDU session pair ID. If the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection is associated with the RSN and the PDN connection supports interworking to 5GS after intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE shall associate the PDU session corresponding to the PDN connection with the RSN.
If there is an EPS bearer used for IMS signalling after intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the QoS flow of the default QoS rule in the corresponding PDU session is used for IMS signalling.
For a PDN connection established when in S1 mode upon an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode if a UErequested PDU session modification procedure has not been successfully performed yetthe SMF shall determine the alwayson PDU session indication as specified in subclause 6.3.2.2.
When the UE is provided with one or more mapped EPS bearer contexts in the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the UE shall process the mapped EPS bearer contexts sequentially starting with the first mapped EPS bearer context.
When the UE is provided with a new EPS bearer identity a new EPS QoS parameters a new extended EPS QoS parameters a new APNAMBR or a new extended APNAMBR in the Mapped EPS bearer context IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a QoS flow the UE shall discard the corresponding associations and associate the new values with the QoS flow.

upon receipt of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message the UE locally deletes the EPS bearer identities for the PDU session if any see subclause 6.4.1.3 and
after successful handover the network shall locally delete the EPS bearer identities for the PDU session if any.
##### 6.1.4.2	Coordination between 5GSM and ESM without N26 interface
When the network does not support N26 interface the SMF does not provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session.
NOTE 1 Since the SMF does not provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session the UE does not know whether interworking with EPS is supported for a PDU session before attempting to transfer the PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode.
NOTE 2 It is up to UE implementation to decide which PDU sessions to be attempted to transfer from N1 mode to S1 mode e.g. based on UE policy or UE local configuration.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMMIDLE mode the UE shall not transfer a PDU session for LADN to EPS.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMMIDLE mode the UE shall not transfer a multihomed IPv6 PDU session to EPS.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMMIDLE mode the UE shall not transfer a PDU session with the selected SSC mode set to SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3 to EPS.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMMIDLE mode the UE shall use the parameters from each PDU session which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to create the contents of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as follows
a if the PDU session is an emergency PDU session the request type shall be set to handover of emergency bearer services. Otherwise the request type shall be set to handover
b the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context as follows
1 the PDN type shall be set to nonIP if the PDU session type is Unstructured
2 the PDN type shall be set to IPv4 if the PDU session type is IPv4
3 the PDN type shall be set to IPv6 if the PDU session type is IPv6
4 the PDN type shall be set to IPv4v6 if the PDU session type is IPv4v6
5 the PDN type shall be set to nonIP if the PDU session type is Ethernet and the UE the network or both of them do not support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode and
6 the PDN type shall be set to Ethernet if the PDU session type is Ethernet and the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode
c the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default EPS bearer context unless the PDU session is an emergency PDU session
d the PDU session ID parameter in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE shall be set to the PDU session identity of the PDU session and
e if the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access the ATSSS request parameter shall be included in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE.
After intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall associate the PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context. If the PDU session being transferred is a nonemergency PDU session the UE shall in addition associate the SNSSAI and the PLMN ID of the current PLMN with the default EPS bearer context.
Upon successful completion of an EPS attach procedure after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode see 3GPP TS 24.301 the UE shall delete any UE derived QoS rules except when the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access and non3GPP access both connected to the 5GCN.
The UE shall perform a local release of the PDU sessions and QoS flows associated with the 3GPP access which have not been transferred to EPS. The UE shall also perform a local release of any QoS flow description not associated with any QoS rule.
For PDU sessions associated with non3GPP access in 5GS if present the UE may
a keep some or all of these PDU sessions still associated with non3GPP access in 5GS if supported
b release some or all of these PDU sessions explicitly by initiating the UE requested PDU session release procedures or
c attempt to transfer some or all of these PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the UE requested PDN connectivity procedures with the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message created as above.
When the network does not support N26 interface the MME does not provide the UE with the mapped PDU session for a PDN connection but provides the UE with an SNSSAI if the PDN connection is not for emergency bearer services. When establishing a new PDN connection in S1 mode to enable the UE to attempt to transfer the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode in case of intersystem change the UE shall allocate a PDU session identity indicate the allocated PDU session identity in the PDU session ID parameter in the Protocol configuration options IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and associate the allocated PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection. If an N5CW device supporting 3GPP access establishes a new PDN connection in S1 mode the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access shall refrain from allocating PDU session identity value 15. The network provides the UE with an SNSSAI and the related PLMN ID in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message the UE shall delete the stored SNSSAI and the related PLMN ID if any and shall store the SNSSAI and the related PLMN ID provided in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
NOTE 3 Since the MME does not provide the UE with the mapped PDU session for a PDN connection the UE does not know whether interworking to 5GS is supported for a PDN connection for which the UE assigned a PDU Session identity before attempting to transfer the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode.
NOTE 4 It is up to UE implementation to decide which PDN connections to be attempted to transfer from S1 mode to N1 mode e.g. based on UE policy or UE local configuration.
NOTE 5 If the PDN connection has been transferred from a PDN connection established via non3GPP access to EPC it is possible that the network provided the SNSSAI already during the establishment via non3GPP access see 3GPP TS 24.302 .
Upon intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMMIDLE mode the UE uses the parameters from the default EPS bearer context of each PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS and for which the UE has allocated a PDU session identity to create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message as follows
a if the PDN connection is for emergency bearer services the request type shall be set to existing emergency PDU session. Otherwise the request type shall be set to
1 MA PDU request if the PDN connection to be transferred is a userplane resource of an MA PDU session or
2 existing PDU session
b the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the PDU session type of the PDU session as follows
1 if the PDN type is nonIP
the PDU session type is set to the locally available information associated with the PDN connection either Ethernet or Unstructured if available or
otherwise the PDU session type is set to Unstructured
2 if the PDN type is IPv4 the PDU session type is set to IPv4
3 if the PDN type is IPv6 the PDU session type is set to IPv6
4 if the PDN type is IPv4v6 the PDU session type is set to IPv4v6 and
5 if the PDN type is Ethernet the PDU session type is set to Ethernet and
c the APN of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the DNN of the PDU session unless the PDN connection is an emergency PDN connection
d the PDU session ID shall be set to the PDU session identity included by the UE in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or to the PDU session ID associated with the default EPS bearer context
e if the PDU session is not an emergency PDU session the SNSSAI of the PDU session shall be set to the SNSSAI included by the network in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER REQUEST message if provided by the network or the SNSSAI associated with the default EPS bearer context if available and
f the SSC mode IE shall be set to SSC mode 1.
NOTE 6 If T3584 is running or deactivated for the SNSSAI and optionally the DNN combination the UE is allowed to initiate ESM procedures in EPS with or without APN corresponding to that DNN and if the APN is congested in EPS the MME can send a backoff timer for the APN to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 .
The UE shall locally release the PDN connections and EPS bearers associated with the 3GPP access which have not been transferred to 5GS.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode if the UE has any PDU sessions associated with one or more MBS multicast sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions and the network shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.
Upon intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode for the PDN connections in the EPS transferred to the 5GS if the UE supports reporting of URSP rule enforcement and is indicated to send URSP rule enforcement report to the network based on the matching URSP rule newly enforced while the UE was in S1 mode which contains the URSP rule enforcement report indication set to URSP rule enforcement report is required the UE shall include the URSP rule enforcement reports IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
#### 6.1.4A	Coordination between 5GSM and SM
Coordination between 5GSM and SM states is not required.
After the 5GSRVCC handover from NGRAN to UTRAN see 3GPP TS 23.216 6A all the PDU sessions of the UE are locally released at the UE and the network. If the UE has any PDU sessions associated with one or more MBS multicast sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions and the network shall consider the UE as removed from the associated MBS sessions.
#### 6.1.5	Coordination for interworking with ePDG connected to EPC
When the UE establishes a new PDN connection via an ePDG connected to EPC to enable the transfer of the PDN connection to N1 mode in case of intersystem change the UE allocates a PDU session identity and indicates its value in the PDU session ID field in the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload of the IKE\_AUTH request message see 3GPP TS 24.302 . The network provides the UE with an SNSSAI in the N1\_MODE\_INFORMATION Notify payload of the IKE\_AUTH response message see 3GPP TS 24.302 .
Upon intersystem change to N1 mode for PDN connections established via an ePDG connected to EPC if present the UE may
a keep some or all of these PDN connections still via ePDG connected to EPC if supported
b release some or all of these PDN connections explicitly by initiating the UE initiated tunnel disconnection procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 or
c attempt to transfer some or all of these PDN connections to N1 mode using the parameters of the PDN connection for which the UE has allocated a PDU session identity by initiating the PDU session establishment procedures with the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message created. In that case for each and every PDN connection to be transferred
1 if the PDN connection is for emergency bearer services the request type shall be set to existing emergency PDU session. Otherwise the request type shall be set to existing PDU session
2 if the previously allocated home address information for a PDN connection consists of an IPv4 address only for an ePDG connected to EPC according to 3GPP TS 24.302 the PDU session type shall be set to IPv4
3 if the previously allocated home address information for a PDN connection consists of an IPv6 prefix only for an ePDG connected to EPC according to 3GPP TS 24.302 the PDU session type shall be set to IPv6
4 if the previously allocated home address information for a PDN connection consists of both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix for an ePDG connected to EPC according to 3GPP TS 24.302 the PDU session type shall be set to IPv4v6
5 the APN of the PDN connection shall be mapped to the DNN of the PDU session
6 the PDU session ID shall be set to the PDU session identity in the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload of the IKE\_AUTH request message establishing IPsec tunnel of the PDN connection
7 if the PDN connection is not for emergency bearer services the SNSSAI of the PDU session shall be set to the SNSSAI associated with the PDN connection as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 . The UE shall not request to perform handover of an existing PDN connection to N1 mode if the associated SNSSAI is not included in the allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access and
8 the SSC mode IE shall be set to SSC mode 1.
If an existing PDU session is transferred from 3GPP access to an ePDG connected to EPC connection and that existing PDU session is associated with one or more MBS sessions the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions and the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.
Upon intersystem change to N1 mode for the PDN connections via an ePDG connected to EPC transferred to the 5GS if the UE supports reporting of URSP rule enforcement and is indicated to send URSP rule enforcement report to the network based on the matching URSP rule newly enforced while the PDN connection is via an ePDG connected to EPC which contains the URSP rule enforcement report indication set to URSP rule enforcement report is required the UE shall include the URSP rule enforcement reports IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
#### 6.2.1	Principles of PTI handling for 5GSM procedures

#### 6.2.2	PDU session types
The following PDU Session types are supported
a IPv4
b IPv6
c IPv4v6
d Ethernet EtherType as defined in IEEE Std 802.3 31A and
e Unstructured.
IP address allocation for IPv4 IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDU session types is described in subclause 6.2.4.
Neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the 5GCN to the UE for Ethernet PDU session type.
#### 6.2.3	PDU session management
The SMF is responsible for the session management functions to provide the PDU connectivity service to the UE via the 5GSM signalling between UE and SMF. The session management procedures includes
a the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure
b the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure
c the UErequested PDU session modification procedure
d the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure
e the UErequested PDU session release procedure and
f the networkrequested PDU session release procedure.
A UE may establish multiple PDU sessions to the same data network or to different data networks via 3GPP access and via non3GPP access at the same time. It is not required for a UE to initiate the PDU session release procedure to release a PDU session associated with another access if any due to the reason that the UE initiates the registration procedure or PDU session establishment procedure over the current access.
NOTE PDU session is managed independently between 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
The session management messages between UE and SMF are transferred via AMF as specified in subclause 8.3.
##### 6.2.4.1	General
This clause specifies IP address allocation for the PDU session.
In this release of specification PDU session can be initiated with one IP version i.e. IPv4 PDU session type or IPv6 PDU session type or with both IP versions i.e. IPv4v6 PDU session type.
IP address allocation to the UE shall be performed by SMF based on one or both the selected IP versions and operator policies. If IPv4 PDU session type is selected an IPv4 address is allocated to the UE. If IPv6 PDU session type is selected an IPv6 prefix except when the SMF acts according to subclause 6.2.4.3 and an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address are allocated to the UE. If IPv4v6 PDU session type is selected an IPv4 address an IPv6 prefix except when the SMF acts according to subclause 6.2.4.3 or 6.2.4.4 and an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address are allocated to the UE. If IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type is selected in a PDU session established by the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG and the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message contains the Suggested interface identifier IE the SMF shall allocate to the UE the interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address indicated in the Suggested interface identifier IE.
For IPv4 PDU session type and for IPv4v6 PDU session type the UE
a shall obtain an IPv4 address via
1 NAS signalling as specified in subclause 6.2.4.2 or
2 DHCPv4 as specified in IETF RFC 2131 33E and
b may obtain IPv4 configuration parameters e.g. DNS server address via DHCPv4 as specified in IETF RFC 2132 33F or may receive IPv4 configuration parameters e.g. DNS server address as specified in subclause 6.4.1 and subclause 6.3.2.
For IPv6 PDU session type and for IPv4v6 PDU session type the UE
a shall build an IPv6 link local address based on the allocated interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address
b shall obtain 64 IPv6 prefix via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and IETF RFC 4862 except when the 5GRG or the WAGF act according to subclause 6.2.4.3
c may obtain IPv6 configuration parameters via stateless DHCPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 8415 33D except when the 5GRG or the WAGF act according to subclause 6.2.4.3 may receive IPv6 configuration parameters e.g. DNS server address as specified in subclause 6.4.1 and subclause 6.3.2 or may receive DNS server IPv6 addresses in a Router Advertisement Message as specified in IETF RFC 4861 38B with recursive DNS server option as specified in IETF RFC 8106 and
d may obtain an additional IPv6 prefix for a PDU session by IPv6 prefix delegation via DHCPv6 as specified in subclause 6.2.4.2a.
##### 6.2.4.2	IP address allocation via NAS signalling
The UE shall set the PDU session type IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message based on its IP stack capabilities if the UE requests IP connectivity as follows
a A UE
1 which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable shall set the PDU session type IE to IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 according to UE configuration or received policy.
2 which is only IPv6 capable shall set the PDU session type IE to IPv6.
3 which is only IPv4 capable shall set the PDU session type IE to IPv4.
b When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE as in the case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE is not known in the MT the UE shall set the PDU session type IE to IPv4v6.
If the UE wants to use DHCPv4 for IPv4 address assignment it shall indicate that to the network within the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST.
On receipt of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message sent by the UE the network when allocating an IP address shall take into account the PDU session type IE the operators policies of the network and the users subscription data and
a if the network sets the Selected PDU session type IE to IPv4 the network shall include an IPv4 address in the PDU address IE
b if the network sets the Selected PDU session type IE to IPv6 the network shall include an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address in the PDU address IE and
c if the network sets the Selected PDU session type IE to IPv4v6 the network shall include an IPv4 address and an interface identifier for the IPv6 link local address in the PDU address IE.
##### 6.2.4.2a	IPv6 prefix delegation via DHCPv6
In order to perform the IPv6 prefix delegation via DHCPv6 the UE shall use DHCPv6 to request additional IPv6 prefixes i.e. prefixes shorter than the default 64 prefix from the SMF. The UE shall act as a Requesting Router as described in IETF RFC 8415 33D and shall insert one or more identity association for prefix delegation options into a DHCPv6 Solicit message.
If the IPv6 address allocation using IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is used the UE sends the DHCPv6 message to request additional IPv6 prefixes to the SMF after the PDU session establishment and IPv6 prefix allocation.
When the UE requests additional prefixes using DHCPv6 the UE may include DHCPv6 Rapid Commit option as specified in IETF RFC 8415 33D in a DHCPv6 Solicit message and the UE other than the ones specified in subclause 6.2.4.3 shall include DHCPv6 OPTION\_ORO option with the OPTION\_PD\_EXCLUDE option code as specified in IETF RFC 6603 40A in the DHCPv6 message.
Upon receiving one or more identity association for prefix delegation prefixes in a DHCPv6 Reply message the UE is allowed to use the allocated additional prefixes after intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode or from S1 mode to N1 mode.
##### 6.2.4.3	Additional RG related requirements for IP address allocation
If IPv6 PDU session type or IPv4v6 PDU session type is selected an IPv6 address one or more IPv6 prefixes or both are allocated to the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device.
If the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device receives a Router Advertisement Message as specified in IETF RFC 4861 38B with the Managed address configuration flag set to zero the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device
a shall obtain 64 IPv6 prefix via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and IETF RFC 4862
b may obtain IPv6 configuration parameters via stateless DHCPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 8415 33D and
c may request additional IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6. If the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device request IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6 the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall act as a Requesting Router as described in IETF RFC 8415 33D shall perform procedures described in subclause 6.2.4.2a. Additionally the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device may include DHCPv6 OPTION\_ORO option with the OPTION\_PD\_EXCLUDE option code as specified in IETF RFC 6603 40A in the DHCP.
If the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device receives a Router Advertisement Message as specified in IETF RFC 4861 38B with the Managed address configuration flag set to one the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device
a shall obtain an IPv6 address via DHCPv6 and the DHCPv6 Identity association for nontemporary addresses option as specified in IETF RFC 8415 33D
b may obtain IPv6 configuration parameters via DHCPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 8415 33D and
c may request IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6. If the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device requests IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6 the 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device shall act as a Requesting Router as described in IETF RFC 8415 33D shall perform procedures described in subclause 6.2.4.2a. Additionally the 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device may include DHCPv6 OPTION\_ORO option with the OPTION\_PD\_EXCLUDE option code as specified in IETF RFC 6603 40A in the DHCP message. The 5GRG or the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device may include both IA\_PD option and IA\_NA option to request the delegated prefix together with the IPv6 address in the same DHCPv6 message.
NOTE The 5GRG and the WAGF acting on behalf of the FNRG or on behalf of the N5GC device can send multiple DHCPv6 requests with different DHCPv6 Identity association for nontemporary addresses options when the 5GRG or the FNRG acts as a DHCP relay for devices behind the 5GRG or the FNRG.
The 5GRG may obtain ACS information via DHCP as specified in subclause 3.1 of BBF TR069 or in BBF TR369 RDIS.1 and RDIS.2.
##### 6.2.4.4	Additional requirements of the UE acting as 5G ProSe layer-3 UE-to-network relay UE for IP address allocation
If a UE acting as 5G ProSe layer3 UEtonetwork relay needs to indicate IPv6 Router or DHCPv4 Server &amp IPv6 Router in the IP address configuration IE as specified in 3GPP 24.554 19E the UE shall support acting as a Requesting Router as described in IETF RFC 8415 33D to request additional IPv6 prefixes i.e. prefixes in addition to the 64 default prefix which was allocated via stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration as specified in subclause 6.2.4.1 from the SMF as specified in subclause 5.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.304 6E.
When the UE acting as 5G ProSe layer3 UEtonetwork relay UE requests additional prefixes using DHCPv6 the UE shall perform procedures described in subclause 6.2.4.2a.
####### 6.2.5.1.1.1	General
In a PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 and Ethernet PDU session type the NAS protocol enables different forwarding treatments of UL user data packets in one or more QoS flows based on signalled QoS rules derived QoS rules or any combination of them.
In a PDU session of Unstructured PDU session type all UL user data packets are associated with the same QoS flow.
####### 6.2.5.1.1.2	Signalled QoS rules
The NAS protocol enables the network to provide the UE with signalled QoS rules associated with a PDU session.
The network can provide the UE with one or more signalled QoS rules associated with a PDU session at the PDU session establishment or at the PDU session modification.
Each signalled QoS rule contains
a an indication of whether the QoS rule is the default QoS rule
b a QoS rule identifier QRI
c a QoS flow identifier QFI
d optionally a set of packet filters and
e a precedence value.
NOTE 1 The default QoS rule indication DQR of a signalled QoS rule cannot be changed.
For case d above
1 If the QoS rule is the default QoS rule of a PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type the set of packet filters contains zero or more packet filters for DL direction and may additionaly contain one of the following
A a matchall packet filter for UL direction
B a matchall packet filter for UL and DL directions
C zero or more packet filters for UL direction other than the matchall packet filter for UL direction
D zero or more packet filters for UL and DL directions other than the matchall packet filter for UL and DL directions or
E one or more packet filters for UL direction other than the matchall packet filter for UL direction and one or more packet filters for UL and DL directions other than the matchall packet filter for UL and DL directions.
The set of packet filters for the default QoS rule shall not be empty. If the default QoS rule contains a matchall packet filter then the highest precedence value shall be used for the default QoS rule.
NOTE 1a Set of packet filters for the default QoS rule can contain only packet filters for DL direction e.g. for determination that local preconditions are met in an IMS session see 3GPP TS 24.229 with a receive only media.
2 If the QoS rule is a QoS rule of a PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type and is not the default QoS rule the set of packet filters contains zero or more packet filters for the DL direction and may additionally contain one of the following
A zero or more packet filters for UL direction other than the matchall packet filter for UL direction and
B zero or more packet filters for both UL and DL directions other than the matchall packet filter for UL and DL directions.
The set of packet filters for a QoS rule which is not the default QoS rule shall not be empty.
NOTE 1b Set of packet filters for a QoS rule which is not the default QoS rule can contain only packet filters for DL direction e.g. for determination that local preconditions are met in an IMS session see 3GPP TS 24.229 with a receive only media.
3 For PDU session of unstructured PDU session type there is only one QoS rule associated with it and the set of packet filters of that QoS rule is empty.
If the UE requests a new QoS rule it shall assign a precedence value for the signalled QoS rule which is not in the range from 70 to 99 decimal.
NOTE 2 In this release of the specification there is no support for a matchall packet filter for DL direction.
NOTE 3 In order to support QoS differentiation in case of access to PLMN services via an SNPN the UE within the SNPN can construct packet filters based on the destination IP address to reach the N3IWF in the PLMN and the security parameters index SPI for the IPsec SA.
NOTE 4 In order to support QoS differentiation in case of access to SNPN services via a PLMN the UE within the PLMN can construct packet filters based on the destination IP address to reach the N3IWF in the SNPN and the security parameters index SPI for the IPsec SA.
NOTE 5 The above described condition of assigning a precedence value for the signalled QoS rule is applied to the UE when the UE requests a QoS rule for network to bind service data flows described by the QoS rule to a dedicated QoS flow by setting the segregation bit to 1.
In NBN1 mode there is only one QoS rule associated with a PDU session and that is the default QoS rule. As described in 3GPP TS 23.501 when the SMF determines that the UE has
a moved from a tracking area in WBN1 mode into a tracking area in NBN1 mode
b moved from a tracking area in WBS1 mode into a tracking area in NBN1 mode or
c moved from a tracking area in NR connected to 5GCN into a tracking area in NBN1 mode
the SMF shall for each PDU session that is kept active initiate the PDU session modification procedure see subclause 6.3.3.2 to delete every QoS rule that is not the default QoS rule if any.
Within a PDU session
a each signalled QoS rule has a unique QRI
b there is at least one signalled QoS rule
c one signalled QoS rule is the default QoS rule and
d there can be zero one or more signalled QoS rules associated with a given QFI.
####### 6.2.5.1.1.3	Derived QoS rules
Derived QoS rules are applicable only for PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type.
The reflective QoS in the UE creates derived QoS rules associated with a PDU session based on DL user data packets received via the PDU session.
Each derived QoS rule contains
a a QoS flow identifier QFI
b a packet filter for UL direction and
c a precedence value of 80 decimal.
NOTE On the network side the corresponding QoS rule can be associated with a different precedence value in the range from 70 to 99 decimal.
Within a PDU session
a there can be zero one or more derived QoS rules associated with a given QFI and
b there can be up to one derived QoS rule associated with a given packet filter for UL direction.
In the UE a timer T3583 runs for each derived QoS rule.
Reflective QoS is not supported in NBN1 mode. Reflective QoS is not applicable for a PDU session with control plane only indication.
####### 6.2.5.1.1.4	QoS flow descriptions
The network can also provide the UE with one or more QoS flow descriptions associated with a PDU session at the PDU session establishment or at the PDU session modification.
Each QoS flow description contains
a a QoS flow identifier QFI
b if the flow is a GBR QoS flow
1 Guaranteed flow bit rate GFBR for UL
2 Guaranteed flow bit rate GFBR for DL
3 Maximum flow bit rate MFBR for UL
4 Maximum flow bit rate MFBR for DL and
5 optionally averaging window applicable for both UL and DL
c 5QI if the QFI is not the same as the 5QI of the QoS flow identified by the QFI and
d optionally an EPS bearer identity EBI if the QoS flow can be mapped to an EPS bearer as specified in subclause 4.11.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 .
If the averaging window is not included in a QoS flow description for a GBR QoS flow with a 5QI indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 the averaging window associated with the 5QI in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 applies for the averaging window.
If the averaging window is not included in a QoS flow description for a GBR QoS flow with a 5QI not indicated in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 the standardized value of two seconds is used as the averaging window.
###### 6.2.5.1.2	Session-AMBR
The NAS protocol enables the network to provide the UE with the sessionAMBR associated with a PDU session.
The standardized value of two seconds is used as the averaging window for the UEs enforcement of the UL rate limitation indicated by the sessionAMBR.
###### 6.2.5.1.3	UL user data packet matching
For PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type upon receiving an UL user data packet from the upper layers for transmission via a PDU session the UE shall attempt to associate the UL user data packet with
a the QFI of a signalled QoS rule associated with the PDU session which has a set of packet filters containing a packet filter for UL direction matching the UL user data packet or containing a packet filter for both UL and DL directions matching the UL user data packet or
b the QFI of a derived QoS rule associated with the PDU session which has the packet filter for UL direction matching the UL user data packet
by evaluating the QoS rules in increasing order of their precedence values until the UL user data packet is associated with a QFI or all QoS rules are evaluated.
For PDU session of unstructured PDU session type upon receiving an UL user data packet from the upper layers for transmission via a PDU session the UE shall associate the UL user data packet with the QFI of the default QoS rule associated with the PDU session.
If the UL user data packet is associated with a QFI the UE shall pass the QFI along the UL user data packet to the lower layers for transmission.
NOTE Marking of the UL user data packet with the QFI is performed by the lower layers.
If all QoS rules are evaluated and the UL user data packet is not associated with a QFI the UE shall discard the UL user data packet.
####### 6.2.5.1.4.1	General
The UE may support reflective QoS.
If the UE supports the reflective QoS the UE shall support the procedures in the following subclauses.
The reflective QoS is applicable in a PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 and Ethernet PDU session type. The reflective QoS is not applicable in a PDU session of Unstructured PDU session type. Reflective QoS is not applicable for a PDU session with control plane only indication.
The UE may request to revoke the usage of reflective QoS for an existing PDU session for which the UE had previously indicated support for reflective QoS.
####### 6.2.5.1.4.2	Derivation of packet filter for UL direction from DL user data packet

Upon expiry of timer T3583 associated with a derived QoS rule the UE shall remove the derived QoS rule.
Upon release of the PDU session the UE shall remove the derived QoS rules associated with the PDU session.
If the network accepts the request from the UE to revoke the usage of reflective QoS and sets the value of the RQ timer to deactivated or zero the UE shall remove the derived QoS rules associated with the PDU session.
Upon intersystem mobility from WBN1 mode to NBN1 mode or from NR connected to 5GCN to NBN1 mode the UE shall remove the derived QoS rules associated with the PDU session that is kept active.
When a derived QoS rule is deleted the timer T3583 associated with the derived QoS rule shall be stopped.
####### 6.2.5.1.4.6	Ignoring RQI in the UE
If the UE receives a DL user data packet marked with a QFI and an RQI and it is not possible to derive a packet filter for UL direction from the DL user data packet as specified in subclause 6.2.5.1.4.2 the UE shall ignore the RQI and shall handle the received DL user data packet.
##### 6.2.5.2	QoS in MA PDU session
In an MA PDU session unless it
a is established over non3GPP access and
b has a PDN connection as a userplane resource
the UE shall have one set of QoS rules one set of QoS flow descriptions and one sessionAMBR. The network can provide the set of QoS rules the set of QoS flow descriptions and the sessionAMBR of the MA PDU session via either access of the MA PDU session. In an MA PDU session the UE shall support
modification or deletion via an access of a QoS rule or a QoS flow description and
modification via an access of the sessionAMBR
of the MA PDU session created via the same or the other access.
In an MA PDU session

b with a PDN connection as a userplane resource
the UE shall have two sets of QoS rules two sets of QoS flow descriptions and two sessionAMBR values one is maintained via non3GPP access and the other is associated with EPS bearer contexts of the PDN connection and maintained via Extended protocol configuration options IE parameters received via the PDN connection.
#### 6.2.6	Local area data network (LADN)
The UE can receive the local area data network LADN information consisting of LADN DNNs and LADN service area information a set of tracking areas that belong to the current registration area during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure see subclause 5.5.1 and subclause 5.4.4.
If the UE supports LADN per DNN and SNSSAI the UE can additionally receive the extended local area data network LADN information consisting of LADN DNNs SNSSAIs and LADN service area information a set of tracking areas configured per DNN and SNSSAI that belong to the current registration area during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure see subclause 5.5.1 and subclause 5.4.4.
If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode the UE considers the received LADN information or the extended LADN information to be valid only in the TAIs of the registered PLMN that are in the LADN service area information and in the TAIs of the equivalent PLMNs if the LADN service area information includes TAIs for the equivalent PLMNs. When the AMF provides the UE with LADN service area information containing TAIs for the equivalent PLMNs the AMF shall include these TAIs of the equivalent PLMNs in the UEs registration area.
If the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode the UE considers the received LADN information or the extended LADN information to be valid only in the TAIs of the registered SNPN that are in the LADN service area information.
The LADN DNNs received by the UE is also considered as LADN DNNs in the equivalent PLMNs.
The UE shall consider itself to be located inside the LADN service area based on the LADN service area information. If the UE does not have an LADN service area information for the LADN DNN the UE shall consider itself to be located outside the LADN service area.
When the UE is located in the LADN service area and the UE is in substate 5GMMREGISTERED.NORMALSERVICE the UE may initiate
the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure with an LADN DNN to establish a PDU session for LADN

the service request procedure to reestablish the userplane resources for the PDU session for LADN or
the service request procedure or the UEinitiated NAS transport procedure to send CIoT user data via the control plane for a PDU session for LADN.
NOTE 1 If the service area list for the service area restrictions is available in the UE and at least one of the LADN information or the extended LADN information are available in the UE the service area list is evaluated before the LADN information and extended LADN information.
NOTE 1A If the partially allowed NSSAI the partially rejected NSSAI or both are available in the UE and at least one of the LADN information or the extended LADN information are available in the UE the UE evaluates the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI before the LADN information and extended LADN information.
When the UE is located outside the LADN service area the UE is allowed
to initiate the UErequested PDU session release procedure to release a PDU session for LADN or
to initiate the UErequested PDU session modification procedure to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status.
The AMF shall determine the UE presence in LADN service area as out of the LADN service area in the following cases
if the DNN used for the LADN is included in the LADN information and the UE is located outside the LADN service area indicated in the LADN information
if the DNN and the SNSSAI used for the LADN are included in the extended LADN information and the UE is located outside the LADN service area indicated in the extended LADN information
if the DNN used for the LADN is included in the extended LADN information and there is no SNSSAI provided by the UE to establish a PDU session for LADN or
if the DNN used for the LADN is included in the extended LADN information and the SNSSAI provided by the UE to establish a PDU session for LADN is not associated with that LADN.
If the UE has moved out of the LADN service area
a the SMF shall
1 release the PDU session for LADN or
2 release the userplane resources for the PDU session for LADN and maintain the PDU session for LADN
according to operators policy and
b the SMF shall not initiate the transfer of CIoT user data via the control plane to the UE for the PDU session for LADN.
In case a2 and b
if the UE has returned to the LADN service area within a specific period of time according to operators policy and the network has downlink user data pending the network reestablishes the userplane resources for the PDU session for LADN
if the UE has returned to the LADN service area within a specific period of time according to operators policy and the network has downlink CIoT user data pending the SMF shall initiate the CIoT user data via the control plane transfer to the UE and
if the UE has not returned to the LADN service area after a specific period of time according to operators policy the SMF may release the PDU session for LADN.
When the UE moves to 5GMMDEREGISTERED state the UE shall delete the stored LADN information if any and the stored extended LADN information if any.
NOTE 2 In this release LADNs apply only to 3GPP access.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMMIDLE mode the UE shall not transfer a PDU session for LADN to EPS.
If
a the UE supports LADN per DNN and SNSSAI
b the UE has a PDU session established using the DNN and SNSSAI which are not associated with any LADN service area indicated in the extended LADN information
c an LADN service area is configured in the extended LADN information which is associated with the DNN and SNSSAI of the PDU session and
d the AMF determines the UE presence in LADN service area as out of the LADN service area configured in the extended LADN information
the AMF requests the SMF to release this PDU session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 .
If

b the UE has a PDU session for LADN established and
c the AMF determines that the LADN service area associated with the DNN and SNSSAI of the PDU session for LADN is removed from the extended LADN information
the AMF requests the SMF to release this PDU session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 .
#### 6.2.7	Handling of DNN based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing DNN based congestion control when one or more DNN congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 are met. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a nonemergency PDU session then the network uses the selected DNN.
In the UE 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN basis except for an LADN DNN in case of PLMN. For an LADN DNN 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control is applied to the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMNs. In case of SNPN if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs in the UE 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN and SNPN basis. If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both in the UE 5GS session management timers T3396 for DNN based congestion control are started and stopped on a per DNN SNPN and selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription basis. Upon receipt of a 5GMM message or 5GSM message from the network for which the UE needs to stop the running timers T3396 associated with an LADN DNN as specified in subclause 6.3.2.3 6.3.3.3 6.4.1.4.2 and 6.4.2.4.2 only the running timer T3396 which is associated with the PLMN and equivalent PLMNs where the timer was started is stopped.
In an SNPN if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs the UE applies the timer T3396 for all the equivalent SNPNs otherwise the UE applies the timer T3396 for the registered SNPN.
The DNN associated with T3396 is the DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment. If no DNN is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST then T3396 is associated with no DNN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN provided to the network during the PDU session establishment. The timer T3396 associated with no DNN will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the timer T3396 associated with no DNN is running it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
In a PLMN if T3396 is running or is deactivated then the UE is not allowed to initiate the
a PDU session establishment procedure
b PDU session modification procedure or
c NAS transport procedure for sending CIoT user data
for the respective DNN or without a DNN unless the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or to report a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status.
In an SNPN if T3396 is running or is deactivated for the registered SNPN is associated with a DNN or with no DNN with the RSNPN and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription then the UE is not allowed to initiate the
a PDU session establishment procedure or
b PDU session modification procedure
for the respective DNN or without a DNN unless the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in the RSNPN or to report a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status.
In an SNPN if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs the timer T3396 is running or is deactivated for all the equivalent SNPNs is associated with a DNN or no DNN with the RSNPN or an equivalent SNPN and with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription then the UE is not allowed to initiate the
a PDU session establishment procedure or
b PDU session modification procedure
for the respective DNN or without a DNN unless the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected SNPN or to report a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status.
If the network does not include timer T3396 with 5GSM cause #26 insufficient resources the UE may use a local backoff timer that has exponential value or a default value which is provisioned using implementation specific means toa prevent sending any 5GSM procedure for the respective DNN till its expiry and
b allow sending any 5GSM procedure for the respective DNN after its expiry.
#### 6.2.8	Handling of S-NSSAI based congestion control
The network may detect and start performing SNSSAI based congestion control when one or more SNSSAI congestion criteria as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 are met. If the UE does not provide a DNN for a nonemergency PDU session then the network uses the selected DNN. If the UE does not provide an SNSSAI for a nonemergency PDU session then the network uses the selected SNSSAI.
In case of PLMN or SNPN in the UE 5GS session management timers T3584 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI DNN and PLMN or SNPN basis. If the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in all PLMNs or equivalent SNPNs is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN then the UE applies the timer T3584 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs. Otherwise the UE applies the timer T3584 for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN. If the timer T3584 applies for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs the timer T3584 starts when the UE is registered in a VPLMN or an unsubscribed SNPN and the SNSSAI is provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment the timer T3584 is associated with the mapped SNSSAI DNN combination of the PDU session.
In case of PLMN or SNPN in the UE 5GS session management timers T3585 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI and PLMN or SNPN basis. If the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in all PLMNs or all equivalent SNPNs is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice then the UE applies the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs. Otherwise the UE applies the timer T3585 for the registered PLMN or registered SNPN. If the timer T3585 applies for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs the timer T3585 starts when the UE is registered in a VPLMN or an unsubscribed SNPN and the SNSSAI is provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment the timer T3585 is associated with the mapped SNSSAI of the PDU session. Additionally if the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the CATBO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in the current access type is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice then the UE applies the timer T3585 for the current access type. Otherwise the UE applies the timer T3585 for both 3GPP access type and non3GPP access type and the UE shall stop any running timer T3585 for the applied PLMN or SNPN and for the access different from the access from which the message is received.
In case of SNPN if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs in the UE 5GS session management timers T3584 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI DNN and SNPN basis. If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both in the UE 5GS session management timers T3584 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI DNN SNPN and selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription basis.
In case of SNPN if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs in the UE 5GS session management timers T3585 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI and SNPN basis. If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both in the UE 5GS session management timers T3585 for the SNSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per SNSSAI SNPN and selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription basis.
If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 was provided during the PDU session establishment procedure the SNSSAI associated with T3584 or T3585 respectively is the SNSSAI including no SNSSAI provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment.
If the timer T3584 is provided during the PDU session modification or PDU session release procedure the UE behaves as follows The DNN associated with T3584 is the DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment. If no SNSSAI but DNN is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message then T3584 is associated with no SNSSAI and the DNN provided to the network during the PDU session establishment. If the PDN connection was established when in the S1 mode then T3584 is associated with no SNSSAI. If no DNN but SNSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message then T3584 is associated with no DNN and the SNSSAI of the PDU session. If no DNN and no SNSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message then T3584 is associated with no DNN and no SNSSAI. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN and the SNSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment. The timer T3584 associated with no DNN and an SNSSAI will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the timer T3584 associated with no DNN and an SNSSAI is running it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
If the timer T3585 was provided during the PDU session modification or PDU session release procedure the UE behaves as follows if an SNSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment then T3585 is associated with the SNSSAI of the PDU session. If no SNSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message then T3585 is associated with no SNSSAI. If the PDN connection was established when in the S1 mode then T3585 is associated with no SNSSAI.

2 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the subscribed SNPN configured for the selected entry of list of subscriber data as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 when the UE is in the subscribed SNPN
3 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368
4 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the subscribed SNPN configured for the selected entry of list of subscriber data when the UE is in a nonsubscribed SNPN and only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the subscribed SNPN is configured for the selected entry of list of subscriber data as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368
5 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN if the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368
6 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the nonsubscribed SNPN configured for the selected entry of list of subscriber data when the UE is in a nonsubscribed SNPN and the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the nonsubscribed SNPN is configured for the selected entry of list of subscriber data as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368
7 for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the nonsubscribed SNPN configured for the selected PLMN subscription when the UE is in the nonsubscribed SNPN and the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the nonsubscribed SNPN is configured for the selected PLMN subscription as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368

b the UE does not send uplink Ethernet user data packets via 3GPP access and
c the UE does not send uplink Unstructured user data packets via 3GPP access.
Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.
NOTE If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off uplink IP packets are filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 in U.3.1.5.
3GPP PS data off does not restrict sending of uplink user data packets via non3GPP access of a single access PDU session or an MA PDU session.
#### 6.2.11	Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session
The UE supporting IPv6 may support multihomed IPv6 PDU session.
If the UE supports the multihomed IPv6 PDU session
a the UE shall support acting as a type C host as specified in IETF RFC 4191 and
b the UE indicates support of the multihomed IPv6 PDU session
1 during the UErequested PDU session establishment of a PDU session of IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type and
2 during the UErequested PDU session modification performed after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode for a PDU session associated with a PDN connection established when in S1 mode if the UE is a UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface the PDU session is of IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type and the UE has not previously successfully performed the UErequested PDU session modification to provide this indication.
#### 6.2.12	Handling of network rejection not due to congestion control
The network may include a backoff timer value in a 5GS session management reject message to regulate the time interval at which the UE may retry the same procedure for 5GSM cause values other than #26 insufficient resources #28 unknown PDU session type #39 reactivation requested #46 out of LADN service area #50 PDU session type IPv4 only allowed #51 PDU session type IPv6 only allowed #54 PDU session does not exist #57 PDU session type IPv4v6 only allowed #58 PDU session type Unstructured only allowed #61 PDU session type Ethernet only allowed #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN #68 not supported SSC mode and #69 insufficient resources for specific slice. For 5GSM cause values other than #26 insufficient resources #28 unknown PDU session type #39 reactivation requested #46 out of LADN service area #54 PDU session does not exist #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN #68 not supported SSC mode and #69 insufficient resources for specific slice and #86 UAS services not allowed the network may also include the reattempt indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to reattempt the corresponding session management procedure for the same DNN in S1 mode after intersystem change.
NOTE 1 In a PLMN if the network includes this backoff timer value for 5GSM cause values other than #27 missing or unknown DNN then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same PLMN DNN SNSSAI PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI combination for the specified duration. If the network includes this backoff timer value for 5GSM cause value #27 missing or unknown DNN then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination for the specified duration. In an SNPN if the network includes this backoff timer value for 5GSM cause values other than #27 missing or unknown DNN then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN SNSSAI or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI combination for the specified duration. If the network includes this backoff timer value for 5GSM cause value #27 missing or unknown DNN then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN combination for the specified duration. Therefore the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this timer value.
NOTE 2 If the reattempt indicator is not provided by the network a UE registered in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN can use the configured SM\_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO or in the USIM NASCONFIG file to derive the reattempt indicator as specified in subclauses 6.4.1.4.3 and 6.4.2.4.3.
If reattempt in S1 mode is allowed for 5GSM cause values other than #27 missing or unknown DNN the UE shall consider the backoff timer to be applicable only to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the rejected 5GS session management procedure and the given PLMN DNN SNSSAI PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI combination. If reattempt in S1 mode is allowed for 5GSM cause value #27 missing or unknown DNN the UE shall consider the backoff timer to be applicable only to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the rejected 5GS session management procedure and the given PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination.If reattempt in S1 mode is not allowed the UE shall consider the backoff timer to be applicable to both NAS protocols i.e. applicable to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the rejected 5GS session management procedure and to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination.
NOTE 3 In the present subclause the terms DNN and APN are referring to the same parameter.
In a PLMN if the backoff timer was provided during the PDU session establishment procedure the UE behaves as follows for 5GSM cause values other than #27 missing or unknown DNN when the UE is registered in a HPLMN the DNN and the SNSSAI of the PLMN DNN SNSSAI combination associated with the backoff timer is the DNN and the SNSSAI provided by the UE when the PDU session is established. When the UE is registered in a VPLMN the DNN and the SNSSAI of the PLMN DNN SNSSAI combination associated with the backoff timer is the DNN and the mapped SNSSAI provided by the UE when the PDU session is established. For 5GSM cause value #27 missing or unknown DNN the DNN of the PLMN DNN combination associated with the backoff timer is the DNN provided by the UE when the PDU session is established. If no DNN or no SNSSAI was provided to the network during the PDU session establishment then the backoff timer is associated with the PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI combination dependent on which parameters were provided for 5GSM cause values other than #27 missing or unknown DNN. If no DNN was provided to the network during the PDU session establishment then the backoff timer is associated with the PLMN no DNN combination for 5GSM cause value #27 missing or unknown DNN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN and the SNSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment.
In a PLMN if the backoff timer was provided during the PDU session modification procedure the UE behaves as follows the DNN associated with the backoff timer is the DNN including no DNN provided by the UE when the PDU session is established. If an SNSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment when the UE is registered in a HPLMN then the SNSSAI associated with the backoff timer is the SNSSAI of the PDU session. If an SNSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment when the UE is registered in a VPLMN then the SNSSAI associated with the backoff timer is the mapped SNSSAI of the PDU session. If no SNSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment then the backoff timer is associated with no SNSSAI. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the DNN and the SNSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment.
In a PLMN the backoff timer associated with the PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN combination will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the backoff timer associated with the PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN combination is running it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
In an SNPN the backoff timer associated with the SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN combination will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session. If the backoff timer associated with the backoff timer associated with the SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN combination it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session.
In a PLMN the network may additionally indicate in the reattempt indicator that a command to backoff is applicable not only for the PLMN in which the UE received the 5GS session management reject message but for each PLMN included in the equivalent PLMN list at the time when the 5GS session management reject message was received.
In an SNPN the network may additionally indicate in the reattempt indicator that a command to backoff is applicable not only for the SNPN in which the UE received the 5GS session management reject message but for each SNPN included in the equivalent SNPN list at the time when the 5GS session management reject message was received.
In a PLMN if the backoff timer is running or is deactivated for a given PLMN DNN SNSSAI PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN SNSSAI PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination and the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM procedures for the PLMN DNN SNSSAI PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN SNSSAI PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination.
In an SNPN if the backoff timer is running or is deactivated for a given SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN combination if the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected SNPN then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM procedures for the SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN or SNPN selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN combination.
The RATC bit in the reattempt indicator IE and its derivation shall not be applicable in an SNPN.
If the network does not include a backoff timer with 5GSM cause #29 user authentication or authorization failed #31 request rejected unspecified and #38 network failure the UE may use a local backoff timer that has exponential value or a default value which is provisioned using implementation specific means to
a prevent sending the rejected 5GSM procedure for the respective DNN till its expiry and
b allow sending the rejected 5GSM procedure for the respective DNN after its expiry.
#### 6.2.13	Handling of Small data rate control
Small data rate control is applicable only to NBN1 mode and WBN1 mode.
Small data rate control controls the maximum number of uplink user data messages including uplink exception data reporting sent by the UE in a time interval for the PDU session in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 . The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink user data messages to comply with the small data rate control policy. The NAS shall provide the indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement. The indicated rates in a NAS procedure applies to the PDU session the NAS procedure corresponds to and the indicated rates are valid until a new value is indicated or the PDU session is released.
If the UE indicates support for CIoT 5GS optimizations the network may provide the small data rate control parameters to the UE and may provide the small data rate control parameters for exception data to the UE if and only if the small data rate control parameters is provided to the UE. Small data rate control parameters and small data rate control parameters for exception data can also be provided to the UE in S1 mode as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 .
If an allowed indication of additional exception reports is provided with the small data rate control parameters and
the additional small data rate control parameters for exception data is provided and the limit for additional rate for exception data reporting is not reached or
the additional small data rate control parameters for exception data is not provided
the UE is allowed to send uplink exception reports even if the limit for the small data rate control has been reached.
During a PDU session release procedure if the small data rate control was applied to the PDU session that is being released the network may store the small data rate control status for the released PDU session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
If
a the UE indicates support for CIoT 5GS optimizations and
b the small data rate control status was stored for the PDU session and is still valid
the network may provide the remaining small data rate control status as initial small data rate control parameters to the UE and initial small data rate control parameters for exception data to the UE during a subsequent PDU session establishment procedure.
If received during the establishment of a PDU session the UE shall apply the initial small data rate control parameters and the initial small data rate control parameters for exception data for the duration of the validity period. When the validity period expires the small data rate control parameters and the small data rate control parameters for exception data shall be applied see 3GPP TS 23.501 .
NOTE 1 The HPLMN can discard or delay user data that exceeds the limit provided for small data rate control.
Upon intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode the UE shall store the current small data rate control status for PDU sessions to be transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
NOTE 2 How long the UE stores the current small data rate control status is implementation specific.
Upon intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode the UE shall use the stored small data rate control status if any to comply with the small data rate control policy for PDU sessions transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 if the validity period of the stored small data rate control status has not expired.
#### 6.2.14	Handling of Serving PLMN rate control
Serving PLMN rate control is applicable only for PDU sessions established for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization.
Serving PLMN rate control protect its AMF from the load generated by user data over control plane.
The SMF can inform the UE of any local serving PLMN rate control during the PDU session establishment procedure see subclause 6.4.1 or the PDU session modification procedure see subclause 6.4.2. If serving PLMN rate control is enabled the SMF shall start the serving PLMN rate control for the PDU session when the first control plane user data is received over the PDU session.The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink control plane user data to comply with the serving PLMN policy provided by the network. The indicated rate in a NAS procedure applies to the PDU session the NAS procedure corresponds to and the indicated rate is valid until the PDU session is released.
Any Serving PLMN rate control information provided by the network to the UE is only applicable for the PLMN which provided this information. This serving PLMN rate control information shall be discarded when the UE successfully registers to another PLMN.
NOTE The serving PLMN can discard or delay control plane user data that exceed the limit provided for Serving PLMN rate control.
#### 6.2.15	Handling of Reliable Data Service
If the UE supports Reliable Data Service see 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 24.250 14A the UE may request data transfer using Reliable Data Service for a PDU session in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during UErequested PDU session establishment procedure see subclause 6.4.1.
The Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDU sessions for which the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indicator is set or with PDU sessions using the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization when the AMF does not move such PDU sessions to the user plane.
The network shall inform the UE about the acceptance of UEs request for Reliable Data Service usage during the PDU session establishment procedure see subclause 6.4.1 in the Extended protocol configuration options IE.
If the network accepts the use of Reliable Data Service to transfer data for the specified PDU session the UE shall use this PDU session exclusively for data transfer using Reliable Data Service otherwise the UE shall not use this PDU session for data transfer using Reliable Data Service.
#### 6.2.16	Handling of header compression for control plane CIoT optimizations
The UE and the SMF may use
IP header compression for PDU sessions of IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type and
Ethernet header compression for PDU sessions of Ethernet PDU session type.
Both the UE and the AMF indicate whether header compression for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is supported during registration procedures see subclause 5.5.1. If both the UE and the network support header compression the header compression configuration for each PDU session is negotiated during the PDU session establishment procedure and PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclauses 6.3.2 6.4.1 and 6.4.2.
For IP header compression ROHC protocol specified in IETF RFC 5795 39B is used. The IP header compression configuration used for IP header compression is renegotiated between the UE and the SMF using the IP header compression configuration IE as specified in subclauses 6.3.2.2 6.4.1.2 6.4.1.3 and 6.4.2.2 respectively.
For Ethernet header compression Ethernet Header Compression EHC protocol specified in 3GPP TS 38.323 is used. The Ethernet header compression configuration used for Ethernet header compression is renegotiated between the UE and the SMF using the Ethernet header compression configuration IE as specified in subclauses 6.3.2.2 6.4.1.2 6.4.1.3 and 6.4.2.2 respectively.
#### 6.2.17	Handling of edge computing enhancements
EAS discovery EAS rediscovery and ECS address provisioning provide enhanced edge computing support in 5GS see 3GPP TS 23.548 10A.
If the network supports the session breakout connectivity model or distributed anchor connectivity model to enable edge computing enhancements and the UE generated DNS message is to be handled by an edge application server discovery function EASDF for EAS discovery as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A the SMF selects the EASDF and it provides its IP address to the UE as the DNS server to be used for the PDU session in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause 6.4.1.3.
NOTE 1 EASDF selection is outside the scope of the present document.
If the network supports the session breakout connectivity model to enable edge computing enhancements and the UE generated DNS message is to be handled by a local DNS server for EAS discovery as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A the SMF selects the local DNS server obtains its IP address and can provide the IP address of the local DNS server to the UE as the DNS server to be used for the PDU session in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure or the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclauses 6.4.1.3 and 6.3.2.2 respectively.
NOTE 2 Local DNS server selection and the acquisition of its IP address is outside the scope of the present document.
If the UE supports EAS rediscovery and the SMF decides to trigger the EAS rediscovery as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A the SMF initiates a networkrequested PDU session modification procedure to provide the EAS rediscovery information to the UE as described in subclauses 6.3.2.2. Upon receipt of the EAS rediscovery information the UE provides the received information to the upper layers.
NOTE 3 The upper layers of the UE uses the EAS rediscovery information to trigger the EAS discovery procedure to get the new EAS information as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A.
If the UE supports ECS address provisioning over NAS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A the UE indicates its support of ECS configuration information provisioning over NAS in the Extended protocol configuration options IE either during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause 6.4.1.2 or while in S1 mode as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 respectively.
If the UE indicated support of ECS configuration information address provisioning over NAS the SMF can provide the ECS configuration information in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure UErequested PDU session establishment procedure or the UErequested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclauses 6.3.2.2 6.4.1.3 and 6.4.2.3 respectively.
NOTE 4 The SMF can obtain the ECS configuration information based on the local configuration the UEs location the UEs subscription information or any combination of them.
If the UE supports the edge DNS client EDC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 10A the UE indicates its support of EDC in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause 6.4.1.2 or the UErequested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclause 6.4.2.2.
If the UE indicates support of EDC the SMF can indicate in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause 6.4.1.3 or the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclause 6.3.2.2 that the network allows the use of EDC for the applications which are mapped onto the PDU session and explicitly requested the use of EDC or that the network requires the use of EDC for all applications mapped onto the PDU session.
#### 6.2.18	Support of redundant PDU sessions
The 5GSM sublayer may support establishment of redundant PDU sessions see subclause 5.33.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 .
In order to establish a set of two redundant PDU sessions a UE can include a PDU session pair ID an RSN or both in a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for each of the two redundant PDU sessions see subclause 6.4.1.2. The UE can set the PDU session pair ID the RSN or both according to URSP or UE local configuration see 3GPP TS 24.526 .
An SMF receiving a PDU session pair ID an RSN or both via a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message operates as specified in subclause 5.33.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 . In addition an SMF can handle two PDU sessions as redundant even if the UE provides neither a PDU session pair ID nor an RSN in a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for each of the PDU sessions see subclause 5.33.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 .
#### 6.2.19	Handling of maximum group data rate limitation control
The network can perform maximum group data rate limitation control to 5G VN groups as specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 . If the maximum data rate of PDU sessions associated within a 5G VN group has been exceeded the maximum group data rate of the 5G VN group the SMF may reject the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message against the 5G VN group using SNSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause 6.2.8 and 6.4.1.4.2.
NOTE 1 The maximum group data rate limitation control does not apply for emergency services or for a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN.
NOTE 2 The maximum group data rate limitation control is performed by the PCF.
#### 6.2.20	Support of UL PDU set handling
If the network supports PDU set handling see subclause 5.37.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 based on operator policy the SMF may provide the protocol description for UL PDU set handling in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message or the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the UE. The UE can store the protocol description and may use it to identify PDUs belong to PDU sets for the uplink direction.
NOTE 1 Whether and how to use the protocol description to identify PDUs belonging to a PDU set in the uplink direction is up to UE implementation. The use of protocol description does not impact UL user data packet matching in the UE.
NOTE 2 Whether and how to process PDUs belonging to a PDU set in the uplink direction is up to UE implementation.
NOTE 3 In this release of the specification UL PDU set handling is supported for non3GPP access.
##### 6.3.1.1	General
The purpose of the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is to enable the DN
a to authenticate the upper layers of the UE when establishing the PDU session
b to authorize the upper layers of the UE when establishing the PDU session
c both of the above or
d to reauthenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of the PDU session.
The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure can be performed only during or after the UErequested PDU session procedure establishing a nonemergency PDU session. The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed during or after the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure establishing an emergency PDU session.
The upper layers store the association between a DNN and corresponding credentials if any for the PDU session authentication and authorization.
If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN the SMF may initiate the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure based on local policy with a DCS as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause I.9.2.4.1 or a DNAAA server as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 subclause I.9.2.4.2.
If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN and the network initiates the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure the UE shall use the default UE credentials for secondary authentication for the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure.
The network authenticates the UE using the Extensible Authentication Protocol EAP as specified in IETF RFC 3748 .
EAP has defined four types of EAP messages
a an EAPrequest message
b an EAPresponse message
c an EAPsuccess message and
d an EAPfailure message.
The EAPrequest message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message of the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure.
The EAPresponse message to the EAPrequest message is transported from the UE to the network using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message of the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure.
If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is performed during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure
a and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully the EAPsuccess message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.
b and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully the EAPfailure message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is performed after the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure
a and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully the EAPsuccess message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the PDU EAP result message transport procedure.
b and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully the EAPfailure message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message of the networkrequested PDU session release procedure.
There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAPrequest message and a related EAPresponse message for the DN to complete the authentication and authorization of the request for a PDU session see example in figure 6.3.1.1.
The SMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETF RFC 3748 subclause 4.3 to infinite value.
NOTE The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure provides a reliable transport of EAP messages and therefore retransmissions at the EAP layer of the SMF do not occur.
Figure 6.3.1.1 PDU session authentication and authorization procedure
###### 6.3.1.2.1	PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation
In order to initiate the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message.
The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to No procedure transaction identity assigned.
The SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the EAPrequest message provided by the DN or generated locally.
The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and the SMF shall start timer T3590 see example in figure 6.3.1.1.
Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message if the UE provided a DNN during the PDU session establishment the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the DNN provided by the UE. If the UE did not provide a DNN during the PDU session establishment the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no DNN if it is running. In an SNPN the timer T3396 to be stopped includes
a the timer T3396 applied for all the equivalent SNPNs associated with the RSNPN or an equivalent SNPN and with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription if running and
b the timer T3396 applied for the registered SNPN associated with the RSNPN and if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder associated with the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription if running.

##### 6.3.1A.1	General
The purpose of the servicelevel authentication and authorization servicelevelAA procedure is to enable the DN using NEF services for authentication
a to authenticate the upper layers of the UE when establishing the PDU session
b to authorize the upper layers of the UE when establishing the PDU session
c both of the above or
d to reauthenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of the PDU session.
The servicelevel authentication and authorization procedure is used for UUAA as specified in 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB.
NOTE 1 The authentication protocol for UUAA is out of scope of 3GPP in this release of specification.
The servicelevel authentication and authorization procedure can be performed only during or after the UErequested PDU session procedure establishing a nonemergency PDU session. The servicelevel authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed during or after the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure establishing an emergency PDU session.
If the servicelevel authentication and authorization procedure is performed during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure
a and the servicelevelAA procedure of the UE completes successfully the servicelevelAA response is transported from the network to the UE as a part of the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message or
b and the servicelevelAA procedure of the UE completes unsuccessfully the servicelevelAA response is transported from the network to the UE as a part of the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.
NOTE 2 If the SMF receives the HTTP code set to 4xx or 5xx as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 20AA or the SMF detects a UUAASM failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.256 21B then the SMF considers that the UUAASM procedure has completed unsuccessfully.
If the servicelevel authentication and authorization procedure is performed for the established PDU session with reauthentication purpose
a and the servicelevelAA procedure of the UE completes successfully the servicelevelAA response is transported from the network to the UE as a part of the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message or
b and the servicelevelAA procedure of the UE completes unsuccessfully the servicelevelAA response is transported from the network to the UE as a part of the networkrequested PDU session release procedure in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
There can be several rounds of exchange of a servicelevelAA payload for the service to complete the servicelevel authentication and authorization of the request for a PDU session see example in figure 6.3.1A.11.
If the UE receives the servicelevelAA response in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message or the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message the UE passes it to the upper layer.

##### 6.3.2.2	Network-requested PDU session modification procedure initiation
In order to initiate the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message.
If the authorized QoS rules of the PDU session is modified or is marked as to be synchronised with the UE the SMF shall set the Authorized QoS rules IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the authorized QoS rules of the PDU session. The SMF shall ensure that the number of the packet filters used in the authorized QoS rules of the PDU Session does not exceed the maximum number of packet filters supported by the UE for the PDU session. The SMF may bind service data flows for which the UE has requested traffic segregation to a dedicated QoS flow for the PDU session if possible. Otherwise the SMF may bind the service data flows to an existing QoS flow. The SMF shall use only one dedicated QoS flow for traffic segregation. If the UE has requested traffic segregation for multiple service data flows with different QoS handling the SMF shall bind all these service data flows to a single QoS flow. If the SMF allows traffic segregation for service data flows in a QoS rule then the SMF shall create a new authorized QoS rule for these service data flows and shall delete packet filters corresponding to these service data flows from the other authorized QoS rules.
If the authorized QoS flow descriptions of the PDU session is modified or is marked as to be synchronised with the UE the SMF shall set the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the authorized QoS flow descriptions of the PDU session.

If the sessionAMBR of the PDU session is modified the SMF shall set the selected SessionAMBR IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the sessionAMBR of the PDU session.
If interworking with EPS is supported for the PDU session and if the mapped EPS bearer contexts of the PDU session is modified the SMF shall set the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the mapped EPS bearer contexts of the PDU session. If the association between a QoS flow and the mapped EPS bearer context is changed the SMF shall set the EPS bearer identity parameter in Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the new EPS bearer identity associated with the QoS flow.
NOTE 0A The SMF can include multiple mapped EPS bearer context fields with the same EPS bearer identity in the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message in cases e.g. the packet filters need to be modified and the modification requires more than one TFT operation codes or the mapped traffic flow template needs to be modified and the modification exceeds the maximum size of the TFT IE.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes a Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE the UE shall check each mapped EPS bearer context for different types of errors as follows
NOTE 3 An error detected in a mapped EPS bearer context does not cause the UE to discard the Authorized QoS rules IE and Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE included in the PDU SESSION MODICATION COMMAND message if any.
a Semantic error in the mapped EPS bearer operation
1 operation code = Create new EPS bearer and there is already an existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity associated with any PDU session.
2 operation code = Delete existing EPS bearer and there is no existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity associated with the PDU session that is being modified.
3 operation code = Modify existing EPS bearer and there is no existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity associated with the PDU session that is being modified.
4 operation code = Create new EPS bearer or Modify existing EPS bearer and the resulting mapped EPS bearer context has invalid mandatory parameters or missing mandatory parameters e.g. mapped EPS QoS parameters or traffic flow template for a dedicated EPS bearer context.
In case 1 if the existing mapped EPS bearer context is associated with the PDU session that is being modified the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the create request and if it was process successfully delete the old EPS bearer context.
In case 2 the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the delete request and if it was processed successfully consider the mapped EPS bearer context as successfully deleted.
Otherwise after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #85 Invalid mapped EPS bearer identity.
b if the mapped EPS bearer context includes a traffic flow template the UE shall check the traffic flow template for different types of TFT IE errors as follows
1 Semantic errors in TFT operations
i TFT operation = Create new TFT when there is already an existing TFT for the EPS bearer context.
ii When the TFT operation is an operation other than Create a new TFT and there is no TFT for the EPS bearer context.
iii TFT operation = Delete packet filters from existing TFT when it would render the TFT empty.
iv TFT operation = Delete existing TFT for a dedicated EPS bearer context.
In case iv after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #41 semantic error in the TFT operation.
In the other cases the UE shall not diagnose an error and perform the following actions to resolve the inconsistency
In case i the UE shall further process the new activation request to create a new TFT and if it was processed successfully delete the old TFT.
In case ii the UE shall
process the new request and if the TFT operation is Delete existing TFT or Delete packet filters from existing TFT and if no error according to items 2 3 and 4 was detected consider the TFT as successfully deleted
process the new request as an activation request if the TFT operation is Add packet filters in existing TFT or Replace packet filters in existing TFT.
In case iii if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer context the UE shall process the new deletion request and if no error according to items 2 3 and 4 was detected after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #41 semantic error in the TFT operation.
In case iii if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context the UE shall process the new deletion request and if no error according to items 2 3 and 4 was detected then delete the existing TFT this corresponds to using matchall packet filter for the default EPS bearer context.
2 Syntactical errors in TFT operations
i When the TFT operation = Create new TFT Add packet filters in existing TFT Replace packet filters in existing TFT or Delete packet filters from existing TFT and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.
ii TFT operation = Delete existing TFT or No TFT operation with a nonempty packet filter list in the TFT IE.
iii TFT operation = Replace packet filters in existing TFT when the packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT.
iv TFT operation = Delete packet filters from existing TFT when the packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT.
v Void.
vi When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.
In case iii the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the replace request and if no error according to items 3 and 4 was detected include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.
In case iv the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the deletion request and if no error according to items 3 and 4 was detected consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.
Otherwise after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #42 syntactical error in the TFT operation.
NOTE 3a An implementation that strictly follows packet filter list as defined in subclause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 might not detect case 2 ii.
3 Semantic errors in packet filters
i When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.
ii When the resulting TFT which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink direction among the packet filters created on request from the network.
After sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #44 semantic errors in packet filters.
4 Syntactical errors in packet filters
i When the TFT operation = Create new TFT Add packet filters to existing TFT or Replace packet filters in existing TFT and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers.
ii When the TFT operation = Create new TFT Add packet filters to existing TFT or Replace packet filters in existing TFT and two or more packet filters among all TFTs associated with this PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values.
iii When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier.
In case i if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the new request after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #45 syntactical error in packet filters. Otherwise the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the new request and if it was processed successfully delete the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter identifiers.
In case ii if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context the UE shall not diagnose an error shall further process the new request and if it was processed successfully shall delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values.
In case ii if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #45 syntactical errors in packet filters.
Otherwise after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause #45 syntactical error in packet filters.
And if a new EPS bearer identity parameter in Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE is received for a QoS flow which can be transferred to EPS the UE shall update the association between the QoS flow and the mapped EPS bearer context based on the new EPS bearer identity and the mapped EPS bearer contexts. If the Delete existing EPS bearer operation code in the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE was received the UE shall discard the association between the QoS flow and the corresponding mapped EPS bearer context and delete the corresponding mapped EPS bearer context.
If
a the UE detects different errors in the mapped EPS bearer contexts as described above which requires sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the erroneous mapped EPS bearer contexts and
b optionally if the UE detects errors in QoS rules that require to delete at least one QoS rule as described in subclause 6.3.2.4 which requires sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the erroneous QoS rules
the UE after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure may send a single PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the erroneous mapped EPS bearer contexts and optionally to delete the erroneous QoS rules. The UE shall include a 5GSM cause IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
NOTE 4 The 5GSM cause to use cannot be different from #41 semantic error in the TFT operation #42 syntactical error in the TFT operation #44 semantic error in packet filters #45 syntactical errors in packet filters #83 semantic error in the QoS operation #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation or #85 Invalid mapped EPS bearer identity. The selection of a 5GSM cause is up to UE implementation.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and a PDU session ID using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 if the UE accepts the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the UE considers the PDU session as modified and the UE shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message contains the PTI value allocated in the UErequested PDU session modification procedure the UE shall stop the timer T3581. The UE should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
NOTE 5 The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For example the UE can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of timer T3591.
While the PTI value is not released the UE regards any received PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission see subclause 7.3.1.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and a PDU session ID using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 if the UE rejects the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the UE shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND REJECT message.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message contains the PTI value allocated in the UErequested PDU session modification procedure the UE shall stop the timer T3581. The UE should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
NOTE 1 The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For example the UE can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of timer T3591.
While the PTI value is not released the UE regards any received PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission see subclause 7.3.1.

If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 3 and the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND messages includes 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested while the UE does not have sufficient resources for initiating the PDU session establishment procedure as specified in subclause 6.4.1 then the UE shall set cause IE to #26 insufficient resources.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes a request to add a new authorized QoS rule or a request to modify the authorized QoS rules or both and the UE decides to reject the request due to e.g. the supported number of authorized QoS rules or number of packet filters associated with a PDU session having reached the maximum number then the UE shall set the 5GSM cause IE to #26 insufficient resources.
NOTE 2 The maximum number of supported authorized QoS rules or packet filters associated with a PDU session is implementation specific.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes a request to add a new authorized QoS flow description or a request to modify the authorized QoS flow descriptions or both and the UE decides to reject the request due to e.g. the supported number of authorized QoS flow descriptions then the UE shall set the 5GSM cause IE to #26 insufficient resources.
NOTE 3 The maximum number of supported authorized QoS flow descriptions associated with a PDU session is implementation specific.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes the Authorized QoS rules IE the UE shall process the QoS rules sequentially starting with the first QoS rule. The UE shall check the QoS rule and the QoS flow description provided in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for different types of errors as follows
NOTE 4 If an error is detected in a QoS rule or a QoS flow description which requires rejecting the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message then the Authorized QoS rules IE the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE and any other IE RQ timer value IE Alwayson PDU session indication IE etc included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message are discarded if any.

5 When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the Authorized QoS rules IE or the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list when the rule operation is delete existing QoS rule or create new QoS rule or the number of packet filters subfield is larger than the maximum possible number of packet filters in the packet filter list i.e. there is no QoS rule precedence subfield included in the QoS rule IE the QoS Rule Identifier is set to no QoS rule identifier assigned when the rule operation is not delete existing QoS rule or the QoS flow identifier is set to no QoS flow identifier assigned when the flow description operation is not Delete existing QoS flow description.
6 When the rule operation is Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the PDU session type of the PDU session is Unstructured and the packet filter list in the QoS rule is not empty.

A rule operation is Create new QoS rule Modify existing QoS rule and add packet filters Modify existing QoS rule and replace all packet filters Modify existing QoS rule and delete packet filters or Modify existing QoS rule without modifying packet filters there is no QoS flow description with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the resulting QoS rule and the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41.
B flow description operation is Delete existing QoS flow description and the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the QoS flow description that is deleted i.e. there is no associated QoS flow description with the same QFI.
8 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description or Modify existing QoS flow description and the UE determines that there is a QoS flow description of a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 which lacks at least one of the mandatory parameters i.e. GFBR uplink GFBR downlink MFBR uplink and MFBR downlink. If the QoS flow description does not include a 5QI the UE determines this by using the QFI as the 5QI
In case 3 the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the deletion request and if no error according to items c and d was detected consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.
In case 6 after completion of the PDU session modification procedure the UE shall send a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operations to delete all the packet filters for the default QoS rule.

Otherwise the UE shall reject the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message with 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation.
NOTE 5 It is not considered an error if the UE determines that after processing all QoS operations on QoS rules and QoS flow descriptions there is a QoS flow description that is not associated with any QoS rule and the UE is not in NBN1 mode.
NOTE 5A An implementation that strictly follows QoS rule operation as defined in subclause 9.11.4.13 might not detect case 2.

In case 1 if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter identifiers are contained in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the UE shall reject the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND with 5GSM cause #45 syntactical errors in packet filters. Otherwise the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and if it was processed successfully replace the old packet filter with the new packet filter which have the identical packet filter identifiers.
Otherwise the UE shall reject the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message with 5GSM cause #45 syntactical errors in packet filters.
If
a the UE detects errors in QoS rules that require to delete at least one QoS rule as described above which requires sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the erroneous mapped EPS bearer contexts and

the UE after sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message for the ongoing PDU session modification procedure may send a single PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the erroneous QoS rules and optionally to delete the erroneous mapped EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall include a 5GSM cause IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

The SMF may continue to use the previous configuration of the PDU session or initiate the networkrequested PDU session release procedure. If the SMF decides to continue to use the previous configuration of the PDU session and
i the Authorized QoS rules IE is included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the SMF may mark the corresponding authorized QoS rules of the PDU session as to be synchronised with the UE and
ii the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE is included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message the SMF may mark the corresponding authorized QoS flow descriptions of the PDU session as to be synchronised with the UE.
b Void.
c Collision of UErequested PDU session release procedure and networkrequested PDU session modification procedure.
If the SMF receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message during the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure and the PDU session indicated in the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message is the PDU session that the SMF had requested to modify the SMF shall abort the PDU session modification procedure and proceed with the UErequested PDU session release procedure.
d Collision of UErequested PDU session modification procedure and networkrequested PDU session modification procedure.
If the network receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message during the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure and the PDU session indicated in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message is the PDU session that the network had requested to modify the network shall

##### 6.3.2.6	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a PDU session inactive for the received PDU session ID.
If the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message belongs to any PDU session in state PDU SESSION INACTIVE in the UE the UE shall set the 5GSM cause IE to #43 Invalid PDU session identity in the 5GSM STATUS message and set the PDU session ID to the received PDU session ID in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in subclause 5.4.5.
b Collision of networkrequested PDU session modification procedure and UErequested PDU session modification procedure.

If the UE diagnoses a semantic error in QoS operations or a semantic error in packet filters in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND as specified in subclause 6.3.2.4 and the message contains other optional information elements the UE shall discard the other optional information elements and shall send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message as specified in subclause 6.3.2.4.
##### 6.3.3.1	General
The purpose of the networkrequested PDU session release procedure is to enable the network to release a PDU session or the userplane resources on a single access of an MA PDU session.
##### 6.3.3.2	Network-requested PDU session release procedure initiation
In order to initiate the networkrequested PDU session release procedure the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session.
The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following 5GSM cause values
#69	insufficient resources for specific slice.
If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 2 and the SMF requests the relocation of SSC mode 2 PDU session anchor with different PDU sessions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 the SMF shall include 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested. If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 1 the SNSSAI or the mapped SNSSAI of the PDU session needs to be replaced the SMF shall include the Alternative SNSSAI IE and 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 1 replaced SNSSAI is available and the SMF determines that the PDU session needs to be reestablished on the replaced SNSSAI the SMF shall include 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested and the replaced SNSSAI in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
NOTE 1 The relocation of SSC mode 2 PDU session anchor with different PDU sessions can also be initiated by the SMF in case of the SMF is requested by the AMF to release the PDU session due to the network slice instance of the PDU session is changed as specified in subclause 5.15.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 .
If the networkrequested PDU session release procedure is triggered by a UErequested PDU session release procedure the SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message to the PTI of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message received as part of the UErequested PDU session release procedure and shall not include the Access type IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND.
If the networkrequested PDU session release procedure is not triggered by a UErequested PDU session release procedure the SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message to No procedure transaction identity assigned.
If the PDU session ID included in PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions and either the Access type IE is not included or the Access type IE indicates 3GPP access the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.
Based on the local policy and users subscription data if the SMF decides to release the PDU session after determining
a the UE has moved between a tracking area in NBN1 mode and a tracking area in WBN1 mode
b the UE has moved between a tracking area in NBS1 mode and a tracking area in WBN1 mode
c the UE has moved between a tracking area in WBS1 mode and a tracking area in NBN1 mode or
d a PDU session is not only for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization any more
the SMF shall
a include the 5GSM cause value #39 reactivation requested in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message or
b include a 5GSM cause value other than #39 reactivation requested in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
NOTE 2 The included 5GSM cause value is up to the network implementation.
If the SMF receives UE presence in LADN service area from the AMF indicating that the UE is out of the LADN service area and the SMF decides to release the PDU session the SMF shall include the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. Upon receipt of the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message the UE shall release the PDU session.
The SMF may include a Backoff timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value #26 insufficient resources is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If the 5GSM cause value is #26 insufficient resources and the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN or the request type was set to initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session for the establishment of the PDU session the network shall not include a Backoff timer value IE.
The SMF may include a Backoff timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If the 5GSM cause value is #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN and the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN or the request type was set to initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session for the establishment of the PDU session the network shall not include a Backoff timer value IE.
The SMF may include a Backoff timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause #69 insufficient resources for specific slice is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If the 5GSM cause value is #69 insufficient resources for specific slice and the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN or the request type was set to initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session for the establishment of the PDU session the network shall not include a Backoff timer value IE.
The SMF should include a Backoff timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value #29 user authentication or authorization failed is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
If the servicelevelAA procedure is triggered for the established PDU session for UAS services with reauthentication purpose and the SMF is informed by the UASNF that UUAASM is unsuccessful or if the SMF receives UUAA revocation notification message from the UASNF as described in 3GPP TS 23.256 6AB the SMF shall transmit the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message to the UE including
a the servicelevelAA response in the ServicelevelAA container IE with the SLAR field set to the value of Service level authentication and authorization was not successful or service level authorization is revoked and
b the 5GSM cause value #29 user authentication or authorization failed in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
If the PDU session was established for C2 communication and the SMF is informed by UASNF that C2 authorization is revoked the SMF shall include
a the servicelevelAA response with the value of the C2AR field set to the C2 authorization was not successful or C2 authorization is revoked in the servicelevelAA container IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and
b the 5GSM cause value #29 user authentication or authorization failed in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.
The SMF shall send
a the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and
b the N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication
1 if the SMF allows the AMF to skip sending the N1 SM container to the UE and the 5GSM cause IE is not set to #39 reactivation requested or
2 if the SMF allows the AMF to skip sending the N1 SM container to the UE and the Access type IE is not included
towards the AMF and the SMF shall start timer T3592 see example in figure 6.3.3.2.1.
Figure 6.3.3.2.1 Networkrequested PDU session release procedure
##### 6.3.3.3	Network-requested PDU session release procedure accepted by the UE
For a single access PDU session upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and a PDU session ID using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 the UE considers the PDU session as released and the UE shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.
For an MA PDU session upon receipt of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message the UE shall behave as follows
a if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes the Access type IE and the MA PDU session has userplane resources established on both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall consider the userplane resources on the access indicated in the Access type IE as released and shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message. If the Access type IE indicates 3GPP access and there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the MA PDU session the UE shall locally leave these associated multicast MBS sessions
b if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes the Access type IE and the MA PDU session has userplane resources established on only the access indicated in the Access type IE the UE shall consider the MA PDU session as released and shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message and
c if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message does not include the Access type IE the UE shall consider the MA PDU session as released and shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.
If the UE is configured with ondemand SNSSAI including slice deregistration inactivity timer
a if the PDU session associated with an ondemand SNSSAI is released and there are no established user plane resources of an MA PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI and there is no PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI the UE shall start the slice deregistration inactivity timer for this ondemand SNSSAI over the corresponding access type
b if the MA PDU session associated with an ondemand SNSSAI is released
for each registered access type if there is no PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI and there are no established user plane resources of an MA PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI over the registered access type the UE shall start the slice deregistration inactivity timer for this ondemand SNSSAI over the corresponding registered access type or
c if the user plane resources of an MA PDU session associated with ondemand SNSSAI are released over the access type and there is no PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI and there are no established user plane resources of an MA PDU session associated with this ondemand SNSSAI over the corresponding access type then UE shall start the slice deregistration inactivity timer over the corresponding access type.
If there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the PDU session the UE considers as released the UE shall locally leave these associated multicast MBS sessions.
If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message contains the PTI value allocated in the UErequested PDU session release procedure the UE shall stop the timer T3582. The UE should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
NOTE 1 The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For example the UE can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of timer T3592.
While the PTI value is not released the UE regards any received PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission see subclause 7.3.1.
If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested then after completion of the networkrequested PDU session release procedure the UE should reinitiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure as specified in subclause 6.4.1 for
a the PDU session type associated with the released PDU session
b the SSC mode associated with the released PDU session
c the DNN associated with the released PDU session and
d the SNSSAI associated with if available in roaming scenarios a mapped SNSSAI if provided in the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure of the released PDU session. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message contains the Alternative SNSSAI IE the UE shall include both the SNSSAI to be replaced and the alternative SNSSAI during the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure.
NOTE 2 User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot reinitiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure automatically.
If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is received without the Backoff timer value IE or includes 5GSM cause #39 reactivation requested and the UE provided an SNSSAI during the PDU session establishment the UE shall stop timer T3585 if it is running for the SNSSAI of the PDU session. If the UE did not provide an SNSSAI during the PDU session establishment and the request type was different from initial emergency request and different from existing emergency PDU session the UE shall stop the timer T3585 associated with no SNSSAI if it is running. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session the UE shall not stop the timer T3585 associated with no SNSSAI if it is running. The timer T3585 to be stopped includes

If the UE did not provide an SNSSAI during the PDU session establishment the UE shall stop the timer T3584 associated with no SNSSAI DNN if it is running. If the UE did not provide a DNN during the PDU session establishment and the request type was different from initial emergency request and different from existing emergency PDU session the UE shall stop the timer T3584 associated with SNSSAI of the PDU session no DNN combination if it is running. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session the UE shall not stop the timer T3584 associated with SNSSAI of the PDU session no DNN if it is running. If the UE provided neither a DNN nor an SNSSAI during the PDU session establishment and the request type was different from initial emergency request and different from existing emergency PDU session the UE shall stop the timer T3584 associated with no SNSSAI no DNN if it is running. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session the UE shall not stop the timer T3584 associated with no SNSSAI no DNN if it is running. The timer T3584 to be stopped includes

##### 6.3.3.4	N1 SM delivery skipped
If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was sent along the N1 SM delivery skip allowed indication towards AMF then upon receipt of an indication that N1 SM delivery was skipped the SMF shall stop timer T3592 and shall consider the PDU session as released.
##### 6.3.3.5	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Expiry of timer T3592.
The SMF shall on the first expiry of the timer T3592 retransmit the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T3592. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3592 the SMF shall abort the procedure.
b Collision of networkrequested PDU session release procedure and UErequested PDU session modification procedure.
When the SMF receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message during the networkrequested PDU session release procedure and the PDU session indicated in PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message is the PDU session that the SMF had requested to release the SMF shall ignore the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and proceed with the PDU session release procedure.

##### 6.4.1.1	General
The purpose of the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure is to establish a new PDU session with a DN to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS to transfer an existing PDN connection in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC to the 5GS or to establish an MA PDU session to support ATSSS see 3GPP TS 24.193 13B or to relay the service associated with the RSC for 5G ProSe layer3 UEtonetwork relay see 3GPP TS 24.554 19E. If accepted by the network the PDU session enables exchange of PDUs between the UE and the DN.
The UE shall not request a PDU session establishment
a for an LADN if the DNN used for that LADN is included in the LADN information IE and the UE is located outside the LADN service area indicated in the LADN information IE
a1 for an LADN if the DNN used for that LADN is included in the Extended LADN information IE and there is no SNSSAI used for PDU session establishment
a2 for an LADN if the DNN used for that LADN is included in the Extended LADN information IE and the SNSSAI used for PDU session establishment is not associated with that LADN
a3 for an LADN if the DNN and the SNSSAI used for that LADN are included in the Extended LADN information IE and the UE is located outside the LADN service area indicated in the Extended LADN information IE
b to transfer a PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access when the 3GPP PS data off UE status is activated and the UE is not using the PDU session to send uplink IP packets for any of the 3GPP PS data off exempt services see subclause 6.2.10
c when the UE is in NBN1 mode the UE has indicated preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization the network has accepted the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization for the UE and the number of PDU sessions that currently has userplane resources established equals to the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources
d to transfer a PDU session from 3GPP access to non3GPP access when the UE has indicated preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization the network has accepted the use of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization for the UE and the Control plane only indication IE was received in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
e to transfer a PDU session from the non3GPP access to the 3GPP access when the UE is in NBN1 mode the UE has indicated preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization the network has accepted the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization for the UE and the number of PDU sessions that currently has userplane resources established equals to the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources
f associated to an SNSSAI when the UE is not in the NSAoS of the SNSSAI or
g associated to an SNSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI when the current TA is not in the list of TAs where the SNSSAI is allowed.
##### 6.4.1.2	UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure initiation
In order to initiate the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
NOTE 0 When IMS voice is available over either 3GPP access or non3GPP access the voice centric UE in 5GMMREGISTERED state will receive a request from upper layers to establish the PDU session for IMS signalling if the conditions for performing an initial registration with IMS indicated in 3GPP TS 24.229 subclause U.3.1.2 are satisfied.
If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session the UE shall allocate a PDU session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU session over either 3GPP access or non3GPP access. If the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access requests to establish a new PDU session via 3GPP access the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access shall refrain from allocating PDU session identity value 15. If the TWIF acting on behalf of the N5CW device requests to establish a new PDU session the TWIF acting on behalf of the N5CW device shall allocate the PDU session identity value 15.
The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated PTI value.
If the UE is registered for emergency services over the current access the UE shall not request establishing a nonemergency PDU session over the current access. If the UE is registered for emergency services over the current access it shall not request establishing an emergency PDU session over the noncurrent access except if the request is for transferring the emergency PDU session to the noncurrent access. Before transferring an emergency PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access or before transferring a PDN connection for emergency bearer services from untrusted non3GPP access connected to EPC to 3GPP access the UE shall check whether emergency services are supported in the NGRAN cell either an NR cell or an EUTRA cell on which the UE is camping.
NOTE 1 Transfer of an existing emergency PDU session or PDN connection for emergency bearer services between 3GPP access and non3GPP access is needed e.g. if the UE determines that the current access is no longer available.
If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session the UE shall include the PDU session type IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and shall set the IE to the IP version capability as specified in subclause 6.2.4.2.
If the UE requests to establish a new nonemergency PDU session with a DN the UE shall include the PDU session type IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and shall set the IE to one of the following values IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 Ethernet or Unstructured based on the URSP rules or based on UE local configuration see 3GPP TS 24.526 and based on the IP version capability as specified in subclause 6.2.4.2.
NOTE 2 When the UE initiates the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure to transfer an existing nonIP PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS the UE can use locally available information associated with the PDN connection to select the PDU session type between Ethernet and Unstructured.
If the UE requests to establish a new nonemergency PDU session with a DN and the UE requests an SSC mode the UE shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the SSC mode. If the UE requests to establish a PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type the UE shall either omit the SSC mode IE or set the SSC mode IE to SSC mode 1 SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3. If the UE requests to establish a PDU session of Ethernet or Unstructured PDU session type the UE shall either omit the SSC mode IE or set the SSC mode IE to SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2. If the UE requests transfer of an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS or the UE requests transfer of an existing PDN connection in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC to the 5GS the UE shall set the SSC mode IE to SSC mode 1.
If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session the UE shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to SSC mode 1.
A UE supporting PDU connectivity service shall support SSC mode 1 and may support SSC mode 2 and SSC mode 3 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 .
If the UE requests to establish a new nonemergency PDU session with a DN the UE may include the SM PDU DN request container IE with a DNspecific identity of the UE complying with network access identifier NAI format as specified in IETF RFC 7542 .
NOTE 3 The UE can avoid including both the SM PDU DN request container IE and the Extended protocol configuration options IE with PAPCHAP protocol identifiers in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. The way to achieve this is implementation dependent.
If the UE requests to
a establish a new PDU session
b perform handover of an existing PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access
c transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS according to subclause 4.8.2.3.1
d transfer an existing PDN connection in untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC to the 5GS or
e establish user plane resources over 3GPP access of an MA PDU session established over non3GPP access only
and the UE at the same time intends to join one or more multicast MBS sessions that is associated to the PDU session the UE should include the Requested MBS container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. In that case the UE shall set the MBS operation to Join multicast MBS session and include the multicast MBS session informations and shall set the Type of multicast MBS session ID for each of the multicast MBS session information to either Temporary Mobile Group Identity TMGI or Source specific IP multicast address depending on the type of the multicast MBS session ID available in the UE. Then the remaining values of each of the multicast MBS session information shall be set as following
a if the Type of multicast MBS session ID is set to Temporary Mobile Group Identity TMGI the UE shall set the multicast MBS session ID to the TMGI or
b if the Type of multicast MBS session ID is set to Source specific IP multicast address for IPv4 or Source specific IP multicast address for IPv6 the UE shall set the Source IP address information and the Destination IP address information to the corresponding values.
The UE should not request to join a multicast MBS session for local MBS service if neither current TAI nor CGI of the current cell is part of the MBS service areas of the multicast MBS session if the UE has valid information of the MBS service areas of the multicast MBS session.
NOTE 4 The UE obtains the details of the MBS session IDs e.g. TMGI Source IP address information and Destination IP address information as a preconfiguration in the UE or during the MBS service announcement which is out of scope of this specification. Preconfiguration can be provided in one or more of the following ways
a in a UE implementationspecific way e.g. factory configuration
b in the USIM see EF5MBSUECONFIG file in 3GPP TS 31.102 or
c in the UE preconfiguration MO for MBS see 3GPP TS 24.575 65.

c the UE requests to transfer an existing PDN connection in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC of IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDN type to the 5GS.
NOTE 5 The determination to not request the usage of reflective QoS by the UE for a PDU session is implementation dependent.
The UE shall indicate the maximum number of packet filters that can be supported for the PDU session in the Maximum number of supported packet filters IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message if
a the UE requests to establish a new PDU session of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDU session type and the UE can support more than 16 packet filters for this PDU session
b the UE requests to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS of IPv4 IPv6 IPv4v6 or Ethernet PDN type or of NonIP PDN type mapping to Ethernet PDU session type to the 5GS and the UE can support more than 16 packet filters for this PDU session or
c the UE requests to transfer an existing PDN connection in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC of IPv4 IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDN type to the 5GS and the UE can support more than 16 packet filters for this PDU session.
The UE shall include the Integrity protection maximum data rate IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to indicate the maximum data rate per UE for userplane integrity protection supported by the UE for uplink and the maximum data rate per UE for userplane integrity protection supported by the UE for downlink.
The UE shall set the MH6PDU bit to Multihomed IPv6 PDU session supported in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message if the UE supports multihomed IPv6 PDU session and

b the UE requests to transfer an existing PDN connection of IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDN type in the EPS or in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC to the 5GS.
The UE shall set the EPTS1 bit to Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode supported in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message if the UE supports Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode and requests Ethernet PDU session type.
If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session as an alwayson PDU session e.g. because the PDU session is for time synchronization or TSC the UE shall include the Alwayson PDU session requested IE and set the value of the IE to Alwayson PDU session requested in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
NOTE 6 Determining whether a PDU session is for time synchronization or TSC is UE implementation dependent.
If the UE has an emergency PDU session the UE shall not perform the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure to establish another emergency PDU session. The UE may perform the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure to transfer an existing emergency PDU session or an existing PDN connection for emergency services.
If
a the UE requests to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access
b the UE requests to perform transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS or
c the UE requests to perform transfer an existing PDN connection in an untrusted non3GPP access connected to the EPC to the 5GS
the UE shall

2 from non3GPP access to 3GPP access
i if the SNSSAI is not in the partially allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access or
ii if the SNSSAI is in the partially allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access but the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which the SNSSAI is supported.
If the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access requests to perform handover of an existing PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access the N5CW device supporting 3GPP access shall set the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message to PDU session identity value 15.
If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS and the UE requests to establish a new PDU session the UE may allow the network to upgrade the requested PDU session to an MA PDU session. In order to allow the network to upgrade the requested PDU session to an MA PDU session the UE shall set MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed in the MA PDU session information IE and shall set the request type to initial request in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the UE is registered to a network which does not support ATSSS the UE shall not perform the procedure to allow the network to upgrade the requested PDU session to an MA PDU session.
If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS the UE may request to establish an MA PDU session. If the UE requests to establish an MA PDU session the UE shall set the request type to MA PDU request in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the UE is registered to a network which does not support ATSSS the UE shall not request to establish an MA PDU session.
When the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access in the same PLMN and the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session the UE may provide an SNSSAI in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message only if the SNSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAIs of both accesses.
NOTE 7 If the UE requested DNN corresponds to an LADN DNN the AMF does not forward the MA PDU session information IE to the SMF but sends the message back to the UE to inform of the unhandled request see subclause 5.4.5.2.5.
If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS and the UE has already an MA PDU session established over one access the UE may perform the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure to establish userplane resources over the other access for the MA PDU session as specified in subclause 4.22 of 3GPP TS 23.502 and the SNSSAI associated with the MA PDU session is included in the allowed NSSAI of the other access. If the UE establishes userplane resources over the other access for the MA PDU session the UE shall

5 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and the UE is in NBN1 mode.
6 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and there is already an existing QoS rule with the same QoS rule identifier.
7 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and the PDU session type of the PDU session is Unstructured.
8 When the flow description operation is an operation other than Create new QoS flow description.
8a When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description and there is already an existing QoS flow description with the same QoS flow identifier.
9 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description the QFI associated with the QoS flow description is not the same as the QFI of the default QoS rule and the UE is NBN1 mode.
10 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description the QFI associated with the QoS flow description is not the same as the QFI of the default QoS rule and the PDU session type of the PDU session is Unstructured.
11 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule and the DQR bit is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and one matchall packet filter is to be associated with the QoS rule.
In case 4 case 5 or case 7 if the rule operation is for a nondefault QoS rule the UE shall send a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the QoS rule with 5GSM cause #83 semantic error in the QoS operation.
In case 6 if the existing QoS rule is not the default QoS rule and the DQR bit of the new QoS rule is set to the QoS rule is not the default QoS rule the UE shall not diagnose an error further process the create request and if it was processed successfully delete the old QoS rule i.e. the QoS rule that existed when case 6 was detected. If the existing QoS rule is the default QoS rule or the DQR bit of the new QoS rule is set to the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the UE shall initiate a PDU session release procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message with 5GSM cause #83 semantic error in the QoS operation.

4 When the rule operation is Create new QoS rule there is no QoS flow description with a QFI corresponding to the QFI of the resulting QoS rule and the UE determines by using the QoS rule’s QFI as the 5QI that there is a resulting QoS rule for a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41.
5 When the flow description operation is Create new QoS flow description and the UE determines that there is a QoS flow description of a GBR QoS flow as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 table 5.7.41 which lacks at least one of the mandatory parameters i.e. GFBR uplink GFBR downlink MFBR uplink and MFBR downlink. If the QoS flow description does not include a 5QI the UE determines this by using the QFI as the 5QI.
In case 1 case 3 or case 4 if the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the UE shall initiate a PDU session release procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message with 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation. Otherwise the UE shall send a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message including a requested QoS rule IE a requested QoS flow description IE or both to delete the QoS rule the QoS flow description or both with 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation.
In case 2 if the QoS rule is the default QoS rule the UE shall send a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message including a requested QoS rule IE to delete all the packet filters of the default QoS rule. The UE shall include the 5GSM cause #84 syntactical error in the QoS operation.

The UE shall check each mapped EPS bearer context for different types of errors as follows
NOTE 11 An error detected in a mapped EPS bearer context does not cause the UE to discard the Authorized QoS rules IE and Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT if any.
a Semantic error in the mapped EPS bearer operation
1 When the operation code is an operation code other than Create new EPS bearer.
2 When the operation code is Create new EPS bearer and there is already an existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity associated with any PDU session.
3 When the operation code is Create new EPS bearer and the resulting mapped EPS bearer context has invalid mandatory parameters or missing mandatory parameters e.g. mapped EPS QoS parameters or traffic flow template for a dedicated EPS bearer context.

The UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an SNSSAI or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an SNSSAI provided by the UE.
If the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in all PLMNs or equivalent SNPNs is included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice then the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs. Otherwise the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN. Additionally if the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the CATBO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in the current access type is included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice then the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for the current access type. Otherwise the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for both 3GPP access type and non3GPP access type and the UE shall stop any running timer T3585 for the applied PLMN or SNPN and for the access different from the access from which the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message is received.
If the Backoff timer value IE is not included or no Backoff timer value is received from the 5GMM sublayer then the UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI or without an SNSSAI as specified in subclause 6.2.8.
When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated the UE is allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency services.
If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED the UE remains switched on and the USIM in the UE if any remains the same and the entry in the list of subscriber data to which timer T3585 is associated if any is not updated then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running and if the USIM in the UE if any remains the same and the entry in the list of subscriber data to which timer T3585 is associated if any is not updated when the UE is switched on the UE shall behave as follows
let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
NOTE As described in this subclause upon PLMN change SNPN change or intersystem change the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the given 5GSM procedure the PLMN or SNPN the SNSSAI and optionally the DNN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or SNPN or when it performs intersystem change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN or SNPN for the same SNSSAI and optionally the same DNN.
Upon PLMN change or SNPN change if T3584 applied for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI a DNN and old PLMN or old SNPN but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI the DNN and new PLMN or new SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI and the same DNN in the new PLMN or new SNPN.
Upon PLMN change or SNPN change if T3585 applied for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI and old PLMN or old SNPN but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI and new PLMN or new SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI in the new PLMN or new SNPN.
Upon SNPN change if T3585 applied for all the equivalent SNPNs is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI and old SNPN but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI and new nonequivalent SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI in the new SNPN.

c For 5GSM cause values different from #8 operator determined barring #27 missing or unknown DNN #32 service option not supported #33 requested service option not subscribed and #70 missing or unknown DNN in a slice the UE behaviour regarding the start of a backoff timer is specified in subclause 6.2.12.
The UE shall not stop any backoff timer
a upon a PLMN or SNPN change
b upon an intersystem change or
c upon registration over another access type.
If the network indicates that a backoff timer for the PDU session establishment procedure is deactivated then it remains deactivated
a upon a PLMN or SNPN change
b upon an intersystem change or
c upon registration over another access type.
NOTE 5 This means the backoff timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given 5GSM procedure when the UE returns to the PLMN or SNPN or when it performs intersystem change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the combination of PLMN DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN in the PLMN or for the combination of SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN mapped subscribed SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN mapped subscribed SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN or SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN in the SNPN.
If the backoff timer is started upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT i.e. the timer value was provided by the network a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above or the backoff timer is deactivated the UE behaves as follows
a after a PLMN or SNPN change

i in a PLMN the same combination of PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN using the same PDU session type if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs or
ii in an SNPN if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs the same combination of SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN or SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN using the same PDU session type if the UE is registered to a new SNPN which is in the list of equivalent SNPNs or
b if the network does not include the Reattempt indicator IE to indicate whether reattempt in S1 mode is allowed or the UE ignores the Reattempt indicator IE e.g. because the Backoff timer value IE is not included then
1 if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list and the backoff timer is running for the combination of PLMN DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or PLMN DNN no SNSSAI the UE shall apply the configured SM\_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 if available to determine whether the UE may attempt a PDN connectivity procedure for the same PLMN DNN combination in S1 mode. If the backoff timer is running for the combination of PLMN no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI the same applies for the PDN connectivity procedure for the PLMN no DNN combination in S1 mode accordingly and
NOTE 6 The way to choose one of the configured SM\_RetryAtRATChange values for backoff timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with
an SM\_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 and
an SM\_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 .
2 if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 is not available and the value for intersystem change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG then the UE behaviour regarding a PDN connectivity procedure for the same PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination in S1 mode is unspecified and
c if the network includes the Reattempt indicator IE indicating that reattempt in an equivalent PLMN or SNPN is not allowed then depending on the timer value received in the Backoff timer value IE for
1 in a PLMN each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the respective DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI DNN no SNSSAI no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or no DNN no SNSSAI combination the UE shall start a backoff timer for the PDU session establishment procedure with the value provided by the network or deactivate the respective backoff timer as follows
i if the Reattempt indicator IE additionally indicates that reattempt in S1 mode is allowed the UE shall start or deactivate the backoff timer for N1 mode only and
ii otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the backoff timer for S1 and N1 mode or
2 in a SNPN if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs each combination of a SNPN from the equivalent SNPN list and the respective the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN mapped subscribed SNPN SNSSAI the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN mapped subscribed SNPN SNSSAI or the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI combination the UE shall start a backoff timer for the PDU session establishment procedure with the value provided by the network or deactivate the respective backoff timer for N1 mode.
If the backoff timer for a PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination was started or deactivated in S1 mode upon receipt of PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message see 3GPP TS 24.301 and the network indicated that reattempt in N1 mode is allowed then this backoff timer does not prevent the UE from sending a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same DNN or without DNN after intersystem change to N1 mode. If the network indicated that reattempt in N1 mode is not allowed the UE shall not send any PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same DNN in combination with any SNSSAI or without SNSSAI or in this PLMN without DNN in combination with any SNSSAI or without SNSSAI after intersystem change to N1 mode until the timer expires the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.
NOTE 7 The backoff timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation e.g. as a timer or timestamp.
NOTE 8 Reference to backoff timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a backoff timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as backoff timers is left up to UE implementation.
When the backoff timer is running or the timer is deactivated the UE is allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure if the procedure is for emergency services.
If the 5GSM cause value is #28 unknown PDU session type and the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message contained a PDU session type IE indicating a PDU session type the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. The UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to establish a new PDU session with the PDU session type IE indicating another PDU session type e.g. using another value which can be used for the rejected component in another route selection descriptor if any as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 . The behaviour of the UE for 5GSM cause value #28 also applies if the PDU session is a MA PDU Session.
If the 5GSM cause value is #39 reactivation requested the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any.
NOTE 9 Further UE behaviour upon receipt of 5GSM cause value #39 is up to the UE implementation.
If the 5GSM cause value is #46 out of LADN service area the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. If the UE is not located inside the LADN service area the UE shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message except for indicating a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for the LADN DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure until the LADN information for the specific LADN DNN or the extended LADN information for the specific LADN DNN and SNSSAI is updated as described in subclause 5.4.4 and subclause 5.5.1. If the UE is not located inside the LADN service area the UE shall not indicate the PDU sessions for the LADN DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure in the Uplink data status IE included in the SERVICE REQUEST message until the LADN information for the specific LADN DNN or the extended LADN information for the specific LADN DNN and SNSSAI is updated as described in subclause 5.4.4 and subclause 5.5.1.
NOTE 10 Based on UE implementation the UE locating inside the LADN service area can send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the LADN DNN which was rejected with the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area.
NOTE 10A If the UE does not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with new LADN information within an implementation dependent time the UE can request this information by initiating a registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3.2 item q.
If the 5GSM cause value is #50 PDU session type IPv4 only allowed #51 PDU session type IPv6 only allowed #57 PDU session type IPv4v6 only allowed #58 PDU session type Unstructured only allowed or #61 PDU session type Ethernet only allowed the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE provided by the network if any. The UE shall evaluate the URSP rules if available as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 . The UE shall not subsequently send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for
a in a PLMN the same DNN or no DNN if no DNN was indicated by the UE and the same mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or no SNSSAI if no SNSSAI was indicated by the UE to obtain a PDU session type different from the one allowed by the network until any of the following conditions is fulfilled

For the 5GSM cause values #50 PDU session type IPv4 only allowed #51 PDU session type IPv6 only allowed #57 PDU session type IPv4v6 only allowed #58 PDU session type Unstructured only allowed and #61 PDU session type Ethernet only allowed the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any.
NOTE 11 For the 5GSM cause values #50 PDU session type IPv4 only allowed #51 PDU session type IPv6 only allowed #57 PDU session type IPv4v6 only allowed #58 PDU session type Unstructured only allowed and #61 PDU session type Ethernet only allowed reattempt in S1 mode for the same DNN or no DNN if no DNN was indicated by the UE is only allowed using the PDU session types indicated by the network.
If the 5GSM cause value is #54 PDU session does not exist the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. If the PDU session establishment procedure is to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall release locally the existing PDU session with the PDU session ID included in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message. The UE may initiate another UErequested PDU session establishment procedure with the request type set to initial request in the subsequent PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to establish a PDU session with
a in a PLMN the same DNN or no DNN if no DNN was indicated by the UE and the same mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or no SNSSAI if no SNSSAI was indicated by the UE or
b in an SNPN the same DNN or no DNN if no DNN was indicated by the UE and the same mapped subscribed SNPN SNSSAI or no SNSSAI if no SNSSAI was indicated by the UE using the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription.
NOTE 12 User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot reestablish the PDU sessions automatically.
If the 5GSM cause value is #68 not supported SSC mode the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. The UE shall evaluate the URSP rules if available as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 . The UE shall not subsequently send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for
a in a PLMN the same DNN or no DNN if no DNN was indicated by the UE and the same mapped HPLMN SNSSAI or no SNSSAI if no SNSSAI was indicated by the UE using the same SSC mode or an SSC mode which was not included in the Allowed SSC mode IE until any of the following conditions is fulfilled

If the UE receives the 5GSM cause value is #33 requested service option not subscribed upon sending PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST to establish an MA PDU session the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. The UE shall evaluate URSP rules if available as specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 and the UE may send PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST after evaluating those URSP rules.
If the 5GSM cause value is #86 UAS services not allowed the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any and shall behave as specified in subcluase 6.4.1.4.1.
Upon receipt of an indication from 5GMM sublayer that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the DNN is not supported or not subscribed in a slice along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session the UE shall stop timer T3580 shall abort the procedure and shall behave as follows
a if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated the UE shall start the backoff timer with the value received from the 5GMM sublayer for the PDU session establishment procedure and
1 in a PLMN the PLMN DNN SNSSAI combination or the PLMN DNN no SNSSAI combination if no SNSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment. The UE shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same DNN and the same SNSSAI that were sent by the UE or for the same DNN and no SNSSAI if SNSSAI that was not sent by the UE until
i the backoff timer expires

##### 6.4.1.5	Handling the maximum number of established PDU sessions
The maximum number of PDU sessions which a UE can establish in a PLMN or SNPN is limited by whichever is the lowest of the maximum number of PDU session IDs allowed by the protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 subclause 11.2.3.1b the PLMNs or SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions and the UEs implementationspecific maximum number of PDU sessions.
If during a UErequested PDU session establishment procedure the 5GSM sublayer in the UE receives an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because
a the PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions has been reached then the UE determines the PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions as the number of active PDU sessions it has or
b the SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions has been reached then the UE determines the SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions as the number of active PDU sessions it has and associates the determined maximum number of PDU sessions with
1 the entry in the list of subscriber data for the current SNPN if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs or
2 the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both.
NOTE 1 In some situations when attempting to establish multiple PDU sessions the number of active PDU sessions that the UE has when 5GMM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of PDU sessions reached in the network.
NOTE 2 When the network supports emergency services it is not expected that 5GMM cause #65 is returned by the network when the UE requests an emergency PDU session.
NOTE 3 The network maintains only one maximum number of PDU sessions for a PLMN regardless of which access the PDU session exists in.
NOTE 3a When the UE is registered on the same PLMN for both 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE maintains single maximum number of PDU sessions for respective PLMN. When the UE is registered on two different PLMNs over 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE maintains maximum number of PDU sessions for a PLMN separately for each PLMN.
NOTE 4 An MA PDU session which only has a PDN connection established as a userplane resource is counted as an active PDU session when determining the PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions.
The PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions applies to the PLMN in which the 5GMM cause #65 maximum number of PDU sessions reached is received. When the UE is switched off or when the USIM is removed the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions.
The SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions applies to the SNPN in which the 5GMM cause #65 maximum number of PDU sessions reached is received. When the UE is switched off the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions. In addition
a if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and equivalent SNPNs and the entry in the list of subscriber data for the current SNPN is updated then the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions associated with the entry in the list of subscriber data for the current SNPN and
b if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder equivalent SNPNs or both and
1 the selected entry of the list of subscriber data is updated then UE shall clear all previous determinations representing SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions associated with the selected entry in the list of subscriber data or
2 the USIM associated with the selected PLMN subscription is removed then UE shall clear all previous determinations representing SNPNs maximum number of PDU sessions associated with the selected PLMN subscription.
Upon successful registration with a new PLMN or SNPN the UE may clear previous determinations representing any PLMNs or SNPNs maximum numbers of PDU sessions if the previous PLMN or SNPN is not registered over both 3GPP access and non3GPP access.
If the maximum number of established PDU sessions is reached at the UE and the upper layers of the UE request connectivity to a DNN the UE shall not send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message unless an established PDU session is released. If the UE needs to release an established PDU session choosing which PDU session to release is implementation specific however the UE shall not release the emergency PDU session.
If the UE needs to release a PDU session in order to request an emergency PDU session it shall either perform a local release of a PDU session or release a PDU session via explicit signalling. If the UE performs a local release the UE shall
a if the PDU session is an MA PDU session
1 perform a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate PDU session status to the network over each access that user plane resources have been established and
2 perform a normal and periodic tracking area updating to indicate EPS bearer context status to the network as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 when a PDN connection has been established as a user plance resource or
b if the PDU session is a single access PDU session perform a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate PDU session status to the network over the access the PDU session is associated with.
##### 6.4.1.5A	Handling the maximum number of allowed active user-plane resources for PDU sessions of UEs in NB-N1 mode
For a UE in NBN1 mode the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources is two as defined in 3GPP TS 36.300 25B when the UE sets the Multiple userplane resources support bit to Multiple userplane resources supported during the registration procedure for initial registration or for mobility and periodic registration update and one otherwise.
For a UE operating in NBN1 mode if
a the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources is one then only one PDU session can have active userplane resources even though that UE might have established more than one PDU session or
b the UEs maximum number of supported userplane resources is two then only two PDU sessions can have active userplane resources even though that UE might have established more than two PDU sessions.
When the maximum number of active userplane resources is reached and upper layers request for more userplane resources for PDU sessions other than the PDU sessions with those active userplane resources the UE can choose to release one or more of the PDU sessions with active userplane resources to cater for the upper layer request. The choice of which PDU sessions to be released is implementation specific. However if there is a PDU session with an active userplane that is used for exception data reporting see subclause 6.2.13 that PDU session shall not be released.
If the maximum number of active userplane resources is reached and the upper layers of the UE request userplane resources for exception data reporting see subclause 6.2.13 the UE shall release a PDU session that has userplane resources to cater for the request for exception data reporting. The choice of which PDU session to be released is implementation specific.
If the UE decides to release one or more active userplane resources to cater for upper layer request the UE shall release the PDU session via explicit 5GSM signalling.
##### 6.4.1.6	Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a Expiry of timer T3580
The UE shall on the first expiry of the timer T3580
if the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message was sent with request type set to initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session then the UE may
a inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure or
NOTE This can result in the upper layers requesting another emergency call attempt using domain selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 .
b deregister locally if not deregistered already attempt initial registration for emergency services.
If the UE sent the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in order to perform a handover of an existing emergency PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall consider that the emergency PDU session is associated with the source access type.
otherwise retransmit the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the PDU session information which was transported together with the initial transmission of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T3580 if still needed. This retransmission can be repeated up to four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3580 the UE shall abort the procedure release the allocated PTI and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the UE sent the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in order to perform a handover of an existing nonemergency PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall consider that the PDU session is associated with the source access type.
b Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to routing failure along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure. If the UE sent the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in order to perform a handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall consider that the PDU session is associated with the source access type.
b1 Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to service area restrictions along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure. If the UE sent the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message in order to perform a handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall consider that the PDU session is associated with the source access type.
b2 Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the UE is registered to a PLMN via a satellite NGRAN cell that is not allowed to operate at the present UE location along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure.
b3 Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the UE is marked in the UEs 5GMM context that it is not allowed to request UAS services along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure. The UE shall not trigger the PDU session establishment procedure until the UE is deregistered from the PLMN.
b4 Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the PLMNs maximum number of PDU sessions has been reached along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure.
b5 Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to unexpected cause along with a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE the UE shall stop timer T3580 and shall abort the procedure.
c Collision of UErequested PDU session establishment procedure and networkrequested PDU session release procedure.
If the UE receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message after sending a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the network and the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is the same as the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
i if the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure was to request the establishment of user plane resources on the second access for an MA PDU session established on a first access and the Access type IE is not included in PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND or the Access type IE included in PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND indicates the first access the UE shall proceed with the networkrequested PDU session release procedure abort the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure stop timer T3580 release the allocated PTI and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE
ii if the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message was sent with request type set to existing PDU session or existing emergency PDU session in order to perform a handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non3GPP access the UE shall abort the PDU session establishment procedure and proceed with the networkrequested PDU session release procedure or
iii otherwise the UE shall ignore the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and proceed with the UErequested PDU session establishment procedure.
d void
e For an MA PDU session established on a single access upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message over the other access if any value of the selected PDU session type selected SSC mode 5GSM cause PDU address SNSSAI DNN IEs in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message is different from the corresponding stored value the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session and perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the PDU session status IE over both accesses.
f For an MA PDU session has a PDN connection as a userplane resource upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message over non3GPP access if any value of the selected PDU session type selected SSC mode 5GSM cause PDU address SNSSAI DNN IEs in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message is different from the corresponding stored mapped value the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the PDU session status IE over non3GPP access and perform the tracking area updating procedure as specified in subclause 5.5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including EPS bearer context status IE.
g Collision of UErequested PDU session establishment procedure initiated to perform handover of an existing PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access and a notification from the network with access type indicating non3GPP access.
If the UE receives a notification from the network with access type indicating non3GPP access after sending a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to perform handover of an existing PDU session from non3GPP access to 3GPP access the UE shall abort the PDU session establishment procedure stop timer T3580 proceed with the service request procedure to perform handover of existing PDU sessions from non3GPP access to 3GPP access.
h Collision of UErequested PDU session establishment procedure and N1 NAS signalling connection release
The UE may immediately retransmit the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and stop reset and restart timer T3580 if the following conditions apply
1 The original UErequested PDU session establishment procedure was initiated over an existing N1 NAS signalling connection
2 the previous transmission of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message was not initiated due to timer T3580 expiry and

Figure 6.4.2.2.1 UErequested PDU session modification procedure
##### 6.4.2.3	UE-requested PDU session modification procedure accepted by the network
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message if the SMF accepts the request to modify the PDU session the SMF shall perform the networkrequested PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclause 6.3.2.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message contains a Port management information container IE the SMF shall handle the contents of the Port management information container IE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 and 3GPP TS 23.502 .
###### 6.4.2.4.1	General
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message if the SMF does not accepts the request to modify the PDU session the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session modification.
The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause values
#95 – 111	protocol errors.
If the UE requests a PDU session modification for an LADN when the UE is located outside of the LADN service area the SMF shall include the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
If the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message indicates 3GPP PS data off UE status and the SMF detects the change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status the SMF shall not include the 5GSM cause value #26 insufficient resources the 5GSM cause value #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice and the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
If the UE initiates UErequested PDU session modification procedure to modify the PDU session transferred from EPS to an MA PDU session with the Request type IE set to MA PDU request in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 13B and the SMF determines based on operator policy and subscription information that the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message is to be rejected the SMF shall include the 5GSM cause value #33 requested service option not subscribed in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
NOTE If the SMF determines based on operator policy and subscription information that the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message is to be accepted as single access PDU session the ATSSS container IE cannot be included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message.
The network may include a Backoff timer value IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
If the 5GSM cause value is #26insufficient resources #67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN or #69 insufficient resources for specific slice and the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was received from a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN or SNPN or the request type provided during the PDU session establishment is set to initial emergency request or existing emergency PDU session the network shall not include a Backoff timer value IE.
The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.
Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message and a PDU session ID using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 the UE shall stop timer T3581 release the allocated PTI value and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was sent with the Requested MBS container IE included and the MBS operation set to Join MBS session and the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message then the UE shall consider the requested MBS join as rejected.
If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was sent with the Requested MBS container IE included and the MBS operation set to Leave MBS session and the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message then the UE shall locally leave the multicast MBS sessions corresponding to the TMGIs in the Requested MBS container IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

The UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an SNSSAI or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an SNSSAI provided by the UE.
If the 5GSM congestion reattempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to The backoff timer is applied in all PLMNs or all SNPNs is included in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value #69 insufficient resources for specific slice then the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs. Otherwise the UE shall apply the timer T3585 for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
If the Backoff timer value IE is not included or no Backoff timer value is received from the 5GMM sublayer then the UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI or without an SNSSAI as specified in subclause 6.2.8.
When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated the UE is allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency services.
If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state 5GMMDEREGISTERED the UE remains switched on and the USIM in the UE if any remains the same and the entry in the list of subscriber data for the SNPN to which timer T3585 is associated if any is not updated then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.
If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running and if the USIM in the UE if any remains the same and the entry in the list of subscriber data for the SNPN to which timer T3585 is associated if any is not updated when the UE is switched on the UE shall behave as follows
let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or less than t then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.
If the UE is a UE operating in singleregistration mode in a network supporting N26 interface and the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message was sent for a PDN connection established when in S1 mode after an intersystem change from S1 mode to N1 mode and timer T3585 associated with no SNSSAI is running then the UE shall reinitiate the UErequested PDU session modification procedure after expiry of timer T3585.
NOTE 3 As described in this subclause upon PLMN change SNPN change or intersystem change the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the given 5GSM procedure the PLMN the SNSSAI and optionally the DNN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs intersystem change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same SNSSAI and optionally the same DNN.
Upon PLMN change or SNPN change if T3584 applied for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI a DNN and old PLMN or old SNPN but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI the DNN and new PLMN or new SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI and the same DNN in the new PLMN or new SNPN.
Upon PLMN change or SNPN change if T3585 applied for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI and old PLMN or old SNPN but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI and new PLMN or new SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI in the new PLMN or new SNPN.
Upon SNPN change if T3585 applied for all the equivalent SNPNs is running or is deactivated for an SNSSAI and old SNPN but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the SNSSAI and new nonequivalent SNPN then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same SNSSAI in the new SNPN.

a Additionally if the 5GSM cause value is #32 service option not supported or #33 requested service option not subscribed then
1 the UE not operating in SNPN access operation mode shall proceed as follows
i if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list the UE shall behave as described above in the present subclause using the configured SM Retry Timer value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 if available as backoff timer value and
NOTE 1 The way to choose one of the configured SM Retry Timer values for backoff timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with

B the SM Retry Timer value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 is available and the UE used the USIM for registration to the current SNPN
then the UE shall behave as described above in the present subclause using the configured SM Retry Timer value as backoff timer value or
NOTE 2 The way to choose one of the configured SM Retry Timer values for backoff timer value is up to UE implementation if both conditions in bullets A and B above are satisfied.
ii otherwise the UE shall behave as described above in the present subclause using the default value of 12 minutes for the backoff timer.
b For 5GSM cause values different from #32 service option not supported or #33 requested service option not subscribed the UE behaviour regarding the start of a backoff timer is specified in subclause 6.2.12.
The UE shall not stop any backoff timer
a upon a PLMN or SNPN change
b upon an intersystem change or
c upon registration over another access type.
If the network indicates that a backoff timer for the PDU session modification procedure is deactivated then it remains deactivated
a upon a PLMN or SNPN change
b upon an intersystem change or
c upon registration over another access type.
NOTE 3 This means the backoff timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given 5GSM procedure when the UE returns to the PLMN or SNPN or when it performs intersystem change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the combination of PLMN DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI in the PLMN or for the combination of SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN mapped subscribed SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN mapped subscribed SNSSAI or SNPN the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI in the SNPN.
If the backoff timer is started upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT i.e. the timer value was provided by the network a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above or the backoff timer is deactivated the UE behaves as follows

Furthermore as an implementation option for the 5GSM cause value #32 service option not supported or #33 requested service option not subscribed if the network does not include a Reattempt indicator IE the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message
1 in a PLMN the same combination of PLMN DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session PLMN DNN no SNSSAI PLMN no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session or PLMN no DNN no SNSSAI if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs or

b if the network does not include the Reattempt indicator IE to indicate whether reattempt in S1 mode is allowed or the UE ignores the Reattempt indicator IE e.g. because the Backoff timer value IE is not included then
1 if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list and the backoff timer is running for the combination of PLMN DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session or PLMN DNN no SNSSAI the UE shall apply the configured SM\_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 if available to determine whether the UE may attempt an EPS bearer resource allocation procedure or an EPS bearer resource modification procedure for the same PLMN DNN combination in S1 mode and
NOTE 4 The way to choose one of the configured SM\_RetryAtRATChange values for backoff timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with
an SM\_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 and
an SM\_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 .
2 if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 is not available and the value for intersystem change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG then the UE behaviour regarding an EPS bearer resource allocation procedure or an EPS bearer resource modification procedure for the same PLMN DNN combination in S1 mode is unspecified and
c if the network includes the Reattempt indicator IE indicating that reattempt in an equivalent PLMN or equivalent SNPN is not allowed then depending on the timer value received in the Backoff timer value IE for
1 in a PLMN each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the respective DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session DNN no SNSSAI no DNN mapped HPLMN SNSSAI of the PDU session or no DNN no SNSSAI combination the UE shall start a backoff timer for the PDU session modification procedure with the value provided by the network or deactivate the respective backoff timer as follows
i if the Reattempt indicator IE additionally indicates that reattempt in S1 mode is allowed the UE shall start or deactivate the backoff timer for N1 mode only and
ii otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the backoff timer for S1 and N1 mode
2 in a SNPN if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs each combination of a SNPN from the equivalent SNPN list and the respective the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN mapped subscribed SNPN SNSSAI of the PDU session the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription DNN no SNSSAI the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN mapped subscribed SNPN SNSSAI of the PDU session or the selected entry of the list of subscriber data or selected PLMN subscription no DNN no SNSSAI combination the UE shall start a backoff timer for the PDU session modification procedure with the value provided by the network or deactivate the respective backoff timer for N1 mode in an SNPN.
If the backoff timer for a PLMN DNN or PLMN no DNN combination was started or deactivated in S1 mode upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message or BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message see 3GPP TS 24.301 and the network indicated that reattempt in N1 mode is allowed then this backoff timer does not prevent the UE from sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same DNN after intersystem change to N1 mode. If the network indicated that reattempt in N1 mode is not allowed the UE shall not send any PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1 in this PLMN for the same DNN in combination with any SNSSAI or without SNSSAI after intersystem change to N1 mode until the timer expires the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.
NOTE 5 The backoff timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation e.g. as a timer or timestamp.
NOTE 6 Reference to backoff timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a backoff timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as backoff timers is left up to UE implementation.
If the 5GSM cause value is #46 out of LADN service area the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. If the UE is not located inside the LADN service area the UE shall not send another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message except for indicating a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status or another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the LADN DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure until the LADN information for the specific LADN DNN or the extended LADN information for the specific LADN DNN and SNSSAI is updated as described in subclause 5.4.4 and subclause 5.5.1. If the UE is not located inside the LADN service area the UE shall not indicate the PDU sessions for the LADN DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure in the Uplink data status IE included in the SERVICE REQUEST message until the LADN information for the specific LADN DNN or the extended LADN information for the specific LADN DNN and SNSSAI is provided by network as described in subclause 5.4.4 and subclause 5.5.1.
NOTE 7 Based on UE implementation the UE locating inside the LADN service area can send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the LADN DNN which was rejected with the 5GSM cause value #46 out of LADN service area.
NOTE 7A If the UE does not receive a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with new LADN information within an implementation dependent time the UE can request this information by initiating a registration procedure for mobility or periodic registration update see subclause 5.5.1.3.2 item q.
If the 5GSM cause value is #37 5GS QoS not accepted #44 Semantic errors in packet filters #45 Syntactical error in packet filters #59 unsupported 5QI value #83 Semantic error in the QoS operation or #84 Syntactical error in the QoS operation the UE shall ignore the Backoff timer value IE and Reattempt indicator IE provided by the network if any. The UE should pass the corresponding error cause to the upper layers.
NOTE 8 How to solve the issues of not accepted 5GS QoS and unsupported 5QI value in the upper layers is UE implementation specific.

### 7.1	General
The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this subclause.
This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown unforeseen and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These procedures are called error handling procedures but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.
Subclauses 7.1 to 7.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.
Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However when extensions of this protocol are developed networks are assumed to have the error handling which is indicated in this subclause as mandatory shall and that is indicated as strongly recommended should.
Also the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during a dedicated connection.
For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 subclause 11.4.2.
#### 7.2.1	Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message type information element that message shall be ignored cf. 3GPP TS 24.007 .

#### 7.6.1	IEIs unknown in the message
The UE shall ignore all IEs with an IEI unknown in a message which are not encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The network shall take the same approach.
#### 7.6.2	Out of sequence IEs
The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The network should take the same approach.
#### 7.6.3	Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T TV TLV or TLVE is repeated in a message in which repetition of the information element is not specified in clause 8 and clause 9 of the present document the UE shall handle only the contents of the information element appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element. When repetition of information elements is specified the UE shall handle only the contents of specified repeated information elements. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded the UE shall handle the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
The network should follow the same procedures.
##### 7.6.4.1	IEIs unknown in the Type 6 IE container information element
The UE shall ignore all IEs with an IEI unknown in a Type 6 IE container information element which are not encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The network shall take the same approach.
NOTE The set of IEIs defined for a Type 6 IE container information element is independent of the set of IEIs defined for other parts of the message. Therefore an IE can be unknown in a Type 6 IE container information element even if an IE with the same IEI is known in other parts of the message and vice versa.
##### 7.6.4.2	Out of sequence IEs

When repetition of information elements in the Type 6 IE container information element is specified the UE shall handle only the contents of specified repeated information elements. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded the UE shall handle the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
The network should follow the same procedures.
### 7.7	Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes
a syntactically incorrect optional IEs and
b conditional IE errors.
#### 7.7.1	Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.
The network shall take the same approach.
#### 7.7.2	Conditional IE errors
When upon receipt of a 5GMM or 5GSM message the UE diagnoses a missing conditional IE error or an unexpected conditional IE error or when it receives a 5GMM or 5GSM message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE the UE shall ignore the message and shall return a status message 5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD with cause #100 conditional IE error.
When the network receives a message and diagnoses a missing conditional IE error or an unexpected conditional IE error or when it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE the network shall either
a try to treat the message the exact further actions are implementation dependent or
b ignore the message except that it should return a status message 5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD with cause #100 conditional IE error.
##### 7.7.3.1	Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a Type 6 IE container information element as not present in the Type 6 IE container information element.
The network shall take the same approach.
EXAMPLE 1 If the Type 6 IE container information element includes 2 type 6 information elements and the first one is syntactically incorrect the receiver ignores the first information element and continues with the processing of the second one.
EXAMPLE 2 If the remaining value part of a Type 6 IE container information element is too short to contain a complete type 6 information element the receiver ignores these octets and continues with the processing of the octets following the Type 6 IE container information element if there are any.
##### 7.7.3.2	Conditional IE errors
When upon receipt of a 5GMM or 5GSM message the UE diagnoses a missing conditional IE error or an unexpected conditional IE error for the contents of a Type 6 IE container information element or when it receives a 5GMM or 5GSM message with a Type 6 IE container information element containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE the UE shall ignore the message and shall return a status message 5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD with cause #100 conditional IE error.
When the network receives a message and diagnoses a missing conditional IE error or an unexpected conditional IE error for the contents of a Type 6 IE container information element or when it receives a message with a Type 6 IE container information element containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE the network shall either
a try to treat the message the exact further actions are implementation dependent or
b ignore the message except that it should return a status message 5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD with cause #100 conditional IE error.
### 7.8	Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received the UE shall perform the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of the present document i.e. of clauses 5 6. If however no such reactions are specified the UE shall ignore the message except that it shall return a status message 5GMM STATUS or 5GSM STATUS depending on the EPD with cause #95 semantically incorrect message.
The network should follow the same procedure except that a status message is not normally transmitted.
### 8.1	Overview
This clause defines the structure of the messages of the Layer 3 L3 protocols defined in the present document. These are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
Each definition given in the present clause includes
a a brief description of the message direction and use including whether the message has
1. Local significance i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access
2. Access significance i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access but not in the network
3. Dual significance i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network or
4. Global significance i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.
b a table listing the Information Elements IE known in the message and the order of their appearance in the message. All IEs that may be repeated are explicitly indicated The V LV and LVE formatted IEs which compose the imperative part of the message occur before the T TV TLV and TLVE formatted IEs which compose the nonimperative part of the message see 3GPP TS 24.007 . In a maximal sequence of consecutive IEs with half octet length the first IE with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N the second IE bits 5 to 8 of octet N the third IE bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence always has an even number of elements.
For each information element the table indicates
1. The Information Element Identifier IEI in hexadecimal notation if the IE has format T TV TLV or TLVE. If the IEI has half octet length it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit followed by a example B.
NOTE 1 The same IEI can be used for different information element types in different messages of the same protocol.
NOTE 2 If a message includes a Type 6 IE container information element then the same IEI can be used for different information element types in the Type 6 IE container information element and in other parts of the same message.
2. The name of the information element which may give an idea of the semantics of the element. The name of the information element followed by IE or information element is used in this technical report as reference to the information element within a message.
3. The name of the type of the information element which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE and generally the referenced subclause of clause 9 of the present document describing the value part of the information element.
4. The presence requirement indication M C or O for the IE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
5. The format of the information element T V TV LV TLV LVE or TLVE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
6. The length of the information element or permissible range of lengths in octets in the message where means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol. This indication is nonnormative.
c subclauses specifying where appropriate conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with other conditions specified in the present document define when the information elements shall be included or not what nonpresence of such IEs means and – for IEs with presence requirement C – the static conditions for presence or nonpresence of the IEs or for both cases see 3GPP TS 24.007 .

#### 9.1.1	NAS message format
Within the protocols defined in the present document every 5GS NAS message is a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 . This means that the message consists of the following parts
1 if the message is a plain 5GS NAS message
a extended protocol discriminator
b security header type associated with a half spare octet or PDU session identity
c procedure transaction identity
d message type
e other information elements as required.
2 if the message is a security protected 5GS NAS message
a extended protocol discriminator
b security header type associated with a half spare octet
c message authentication code
d sequence number
e plain 5GS NAS message as defined in item 1
The organization of a plain 5GS NAS message is illustrated in the example shown in figure 9.1.1.1.
Figure 9.1.1.1 General message organization example for a plain 5GS NAS message
The PDU session identity and the procedure transaction identity are only used in messages with extended protocol discriminator 5GS session management. Octet 2a with the procedure transaction identity shall only be included in these messages.
The organization of a security protected 5GS NAS message is illustrated in the example shown in figure 9.1.1.2.
Figure 9.1.1.2 General message organization example for a security protected 5GS NAS message
Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 8 and annex D a particular information element shall not be present more than once in a given message.
#### 9.1.2	Field format and mapping
When a field is contained within a single octet the lowest numbered bit of the field represents the least significant bit.
When a field extends over more than one octet the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number increases. In that part of the field contained in a given octet the lowest numbered bit represents the least significant bit. The most significant bit of the field is represented by the highest numbered bit of the lowest numbered octet of the field. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet of the field.
For example a bit number can be identified as a couple o b where o is the octet number and b is the relative bit number within the octet. Figure 9.1.2.1 illustrates a field that spans from bit 1 3 to bit 2 7. The most significant bit of the field is mapped on bit 1 3 and the least significant bit is mapped on bit 2 7.
Figure 9.1.2.1 Field mapping convention
### 9.2	Extended protocol discriminator
Bits 1 to 8 of the first octet of every 5GS NAS message contain the Extended protocol discriminator EPD IE. The EPD and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 . The extended protocol discriminator in the header see 3GPP TS 24.007 of a security protected 5GS NAS message is encoded as 5GS mobility management messages.
### 9.3	Security header type
Bits 1 to 4 of the second octet of every 5GMM message contain the Security header type IE. This IE includes control information related to the security protection of a 5GMM message. The total size of the Security header type IE is 4 bits.
The Security header type IE can take the values shown in table 9.3.1.
Table 9.3.1 Security header type
A 5GMM message received with the security header type encoded as 0000 shall be treated as not security protected plain 5GS NAS message. A protocol entity sending a not security protected 5GMM message shall send the message as plain 5GS NAS message and encode the security header type as 0000.
### 9.4	PDU session identity
Bits 1 to 8 of the second octet of every 5GSM message contain the PDU session identity IE. The PDU session identity and its use to identify a message flow are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
### 9.5	Spare half octet
This element is used in the description of 5GMM and 5GSM messages when an odd number of half octet type 1 information elements are used. This element is filled with spare bits set to zero and is placed in bits 5 to 8 of the octet unless otherwise specified.
### 9.6	Procedure transaction identity
Bits 1 to 8 of the third octet of every 5GSM message contain the procedure transaction identity. Bits 1 to 8 of the first octet of every UE policy delivery message contain the procedure transaction identity. The procedure transaction identity and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
### 9.7	Message type
The Message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 . Tables 9.7.1 and 9.7.2 define the value part of the message type IE used in the 5GS mobility management protocol and 5GS session management protocol.

The usage of SN is specified in subclause 4.4.3.
#### 9.11.1	General
The different formats V LV T TV TLV LVE TLVE and the five categories of information elements type 1 2 3 4 and 6 are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The first octet of an information element in the nonimperative part contains the IEI of the information element. If this octet does not correspond to an IEI known in the message the receiver shall determine whether this IE is of type 1 or 2 i.e. it is an information element of one octet length or an IE of type 4 or 6 i.e. that the next octet is the length indicator or for a type 6 IE the next 2 octets are the length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the information element see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
NOTE This requirement for the receiver is not applicable for information elements included in a Type 6 IE container information element. Any IE in the Type 6 IE container information element is of type 6 with format TLVE therefore the rules for the IEI value encoding defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 subclause 11.2.4 are not applicable.

### D.1.1	Overview
The UE provides the PCF with a list of one or more stored UE policy section identifiers UPSIs during the UEinitiated UE state indication procedure. The UPSI is composed of two parts
a a PLMN ID part containing
1 the PLMN ID for the PLMN or
2 the PLMN ID part of the SNPN identity for the SNPN
of the PCF which provides the UE policies and
b a UE policy section code UPSC containing a value assigned by the PCF.
During the UEinitiated UE state indication procedure the UE also provides the PCF with the UE policy related capabilities such as the UEs support for ANDSP the UEs support for URSP provisioning in EPS and the UEs OS Id.
During the networkrequested UE policy management procedure the PCF provides the UE with one or more UE policy sections containing UE policies. The UE processes the received UE policy sections each identified by the UPSI received from the PCF and informs the PCF of the result.
In the present annex the condition that the PLMN ID part of the UPSI is referring to the HPLMN shall be considered as fulfilled only if the PLMN ID is equal to the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI.
NOTE This is also applicable if the UE has a nonempty EHPLMN list even if the EHPLMN list does not include the PLMN ID derived from the IMSI.
The UE can also request the PCF to provide V2XP as specified in 3GPP TS 24.587 19B.
The UE can also request the PCF to provide ProSeP as specified in 3GPP TS 24.554 19E.
The UE can also request the PCF to provide A2XP as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 .
The UE can also request the PCF to provide RSLPP as specified in 3GPP TS 24.514 .
### D.1.2	Principles of PTI handling for UE policy delivery service procedures
When the PCF or the UE initiates a procedure it shall include a valid PTI value in the message header of the command message or the request message. When the UE initiates a procedure the UE shall use a PTI value in range between 01H and 77H. When the PCF initiates a procedure the PCF shall use a PTI value in range between 80H and FEH.
When the PCF initiates a transaction related procedure i.e. a procedure consisting of more than one message and the messages are related it shall include a valid PTI value in the message header of the command message.
If a response message is sent as result of a received command or request message the UE or the PCF shall include in the response message the PTI value received within the received command or request message see examples in figure D.1.2.1 figure D.1.2.2 and figure D.1.2.3.
If a command message is sent as result of a received request message the PCF shall include in the command message the PTI value received with the request message see examples in figure D.1.2.3.
Figure D.1.2.1 Networkrequested transaction related procedure
Figure D.1.2.2 UErequested transaction related procedure rejected by the network
Figure D.1.2.3 UErequested transaction related procedure triggering a networkrequested transaction related procedure
NOTE In earlier versions of this protocol the UE can include in the response message a PTI value which is not the same as the one received within the command message and therefore the PCF could not associate the response message from the UE to the command message sent.
#### D.2.1.1	General
The purpose of the networkrequested UE policy management procedure is to enable the network to
a add one or more new UE policy sections to the UE
b modify one or more UE policy sections stored at the UE or
c delete one or more UE policy sections stored at the UE
and optionally to enable the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN to provide a UE accessing the subscribed SNPN or the HPLMN with a nonsubscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication indicating whether the UE is allowed to accept URSP signalled by nonsubscribed SNPNs.
#### D.2.1.2	Network-requested UE policy management procedure initiation
In order to initiate the networkrequested UE policy management procedure the PCF shall
a if the networkrequested UE policy management procedure is triggered by the UErequested V2X policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.587 19B the UErequested ProSe policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.554 19E or the UErequested A2X policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 then set the PTI IE to the PTI value of the received UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST message of the UErequested V2X policy provisioning procedure the UErequested ProSe policy provisioning procedure or the UErequested A2X policy provisioning procedure otherwise allocate a PTI value currently not used and set the PTI IE to the allocated PTI value
b encode the information about the UE policy sections to be added modified or deleted in a UE policy section management list IE as specified in subclause D.6.2 and include it in a MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message
c if the PCF is a PCF of the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN optionally include the UE policy network classmark IE in a MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and set the nonsubscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication of the UE policy network classmark IE to UE is not allowed to accept URSP signalled by nonsubscribed SNPNs or UE is allowed to accept URSP signalled by nonsubscribed SNPNs
c1 if the UE supports VPS URSP optionally encode the information about entries of VPS URSP configuration to be added modified or deleted in the VPS URSP configuration IE as specified in subclause D.6.8 and include it in a MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message
d send the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message to the UE via the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 and
e start timer T3501 see example in figure D.2.1.2.1.
NOTE The PCF starts a different timer T3501 for each PTI value.
Figure D.2.1.2.1 Networkrequested UE policy management procedure
Upon receipt of the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message with a PTI value currently not used by a networkrequested UE policy management procedure for each instruction included in the UE policy section management list IE the UE shall
a store the received UE policy section of the instruction if the UE has no stored UE policy section associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the instruction
b replace the stored UE policy section with the received UE policy section of the instruction if the UE has a stored UE policy section associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the instruction or
c delete the stored UE policy section if the UE has a stored UE policy section associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the instruction and the UE policy section of the instruction is empty
additionally if the UE policy network classmark IE is included in the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and
a the UE has an empty EHPLMN list or the EHPLMN list is not present and the UEs RPLMN is the HPLMN
b the UE has a nonempty EHPLMN list and the UEs RPLMN is an EHPLMN or
c the UEs RSNPN is the subscribed SNPN
the UE shall delete the nonsubscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication stored for the selected entry of list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription if any and store the nonsubscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication received in the UE policy network classmark IE for the selected entry of list of subscriber data or the selected PLMN subscription.
If the UE supports the VPS URSP and the VPS URSP configuration is included in the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message
a if the replacement type field of the received VPS URSP configuration indicates full list of tuples the UE shall delete the stored VPS URSP configuration if any and
b if the received VPS URSP configuration contains one or more tuples
1 if the UE does not have the stored VPS URSP configuration the UE shall store the received VPS URSP configuration except zero or more tuples with no UPSCs or
2 otherwise
i for each tuple with a tuple ID in the stored VPS URSP configuration
A if a tuple with the tuple ID is in the received VPS URSP configuration and contains
no UPSCs the UE shall delete the tuple with the tuple ID from the stored VPS URSP configuration or
one or more UPSCs the UE shall replace the tuple with the tuple ID in the stored VPS URSP configuration with the tuple with the tuple ID from the received VPS URSP configuration or
B if no tuple with the tuple ID is in the received VPS URSP configuration the UE shall keep the tuple with the tuple ID in the stored VPS URSP configuration and
ii for each tuple with a tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration if no tuple with the tuple ID is in the stored VPS URSP configuration and
A the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration contains no UPSCs the UE shall ignore the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration or
B the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration contains one or more UPSCs the UE shall add the tuple with the tuple ID from the received VPS URSP configuration to the stored VPS URSP configuration.
The UE may continue storing a received UE policy section for a PLMN or SNPN when the UE registers in another PLMN or SNPN. If necessary the UE may delete UE policy sections stored for a PLMN other than the RPLMN and the HPLMN or for an SNPN other than the registered SNPN and the subscribed SNPN before storing the new received UE policy sections.
When storing a UE policy section received from an SNPN the UE shall associate the NID of that SNPN with the UPSI of the stored UE policy section.
NOTE The maximum number of UE policy sections for PLMNs or SNPNs other than the HPLMN and the RPLMN or the registered SNPN and the subscribed SNPN that the UE can store and how the UE selects the UE policy sections to be deleted are up to the UE implementation.
#### D.2.1.3	Network-requested UE policy management procedure accepted by the UE
If all instructions included in the UE policy section management list IE were executed successfully by the UE the UE shall
a create a MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE message including the PTI value received within the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and
b transport the MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE message using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5.
Upon receipt of the MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE message the PCF shall stop timer T3501. The PCF should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
NOTE The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For example the PCF can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of timer T3501.
#### D.2.1.4	Network-requested UE policy management procedure not accepted by the UE
If the UE could not execute all instructions included in the UE policy section management list IE successfully the UE shall
a set the PTI IE to the PTI value received within the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and encode the results by including
1 the UPSI associated with the instructions which could not be executed successfully
2 the failed instruction order set to order of the instruction in the UE policy section management sublist of the received UE policy section management list IE which could not be executed successfully and
3 the cause of the failure
in the UE policy section management result IE as specified in subclause D.6.3 and include it in a MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message and
b transport the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5.
Upon receipt of the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message the PCF shall stop timer T3501. Any instruction that was included in the UE policy section management list IE but not indicatedin the UE policy section management result IE of the received MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message shall be considered as successfully executed.
The PCF should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
NOTE The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For example the PCF can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of timer T3501.
Upon receipt of the notification from the AMF that the UE is not reachable the PCF shall stop the T3501.
#### D.2.1.5	Abnormal cases on the network side
The following abnormal cases can be identified
a T3501 expired.
The PCF shall on the first expiry of the timer T3501 retransmit the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T3501. This retransmission is repeated four times i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3501 the PCF shall abort the procedure and release the allocated PTI.

### D.8.1	General
The procedures specified in the subclause apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this subclause.
This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown unforeseen and erroneous UPDS data by the receiving entity. These procedures are called error handling procedures but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the UPDS.
Subclauses D.8.1 to D.8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.
Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However when extensions of UPDS are developed networks are assumed to have the error handling which is indicated in this subclause as mandatory shall and that is indicated as strongly recommended should.
Also the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during a dedicated connection.
For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 subclause 11.4.2.
#### D.8.2.1	Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message type information element that message shall be ignored c.f. 3GPP TS 24.007 .
#### D.8.2.2	Message too long
The maximum size of a UE policy delivery service message is 65535 octets.
#### D.8.3.1	Procedure transaction identity
The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown erroneous or unforeseen PTI received in a UPDS message
a In case the network receives a MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE message or MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message in which the PTI value is an assigned or unassigned value that does not match any PTI in use the network shall ignore the UPDS message.
b In case the network receives a UPDS message in which the PTI value is a reserved value the network shall ignore the UPDS message.
The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown erroneous or unforeseen PTI received in a UPDS message
a In case the UE receives a UPDS message in which the PTI value is a reserved value the UE shall ignore the UPDS message.
### D.8.4	Unknown or unforeseen message type
If the UE or the network receives a UPDS message with message type not defined for the UPDS or not implemented by the receiver it shall ignore the UPDS message.
NOTE A message type not defined for the UPDS in the given direction is regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the UPDS see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
If the UE receives a message not compatible with the UPDS state the UE shall ignore the UPDS message.
If the network receives a message not compatible with the UPDS state the network actions are implementation dependent.
#### D.8.5.1	Common procedures
When on receipt of a message
a an imperative message part error or
b a missing mandatory IE error
is diagnosed or when a message containing
a a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE
b an IE with an IEI unknown in the message but encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 or
c an out of sequence IE encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 is received
the UE shall ignore the UPDS message
the network shall proceed as follows
the network shall
1 try to treat the message the exact further actions are implementation dependent or
2 ignore the message.
#### D.8.6.1	IEIs unknown in the message
The UE shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The network shall take the same approach.
#### D.8.6.2	Out of sequence IEs
The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded as comprehension required see 3GPP TS 24.007 .
The network should take the same approach.
#### D.8.6.3	Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T TV TLV or TLVE is repeated in a message in which repetition of the information element is not specified in subclause D.5 the UE shall handle only the contents of the information element appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element. When repetition of information elements is specified the UE shall handle only the contents of specified repeated information elements. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded the UE shall handle the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
The network should follow the same procedures.
### D.8.7	Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes
a syntactically incorrect optional IEs and
b conditional IE errors.
#### D.8.7.1	Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.
The network shall take the same approach.
