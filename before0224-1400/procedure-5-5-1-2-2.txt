**Key Information and Description**

*   **Procedure Name:** Initial Registration Initiation
*   **Initial State:** 5GMM-DEREGISTERED
*   **Trigger:** The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration under various conditions, including:

    *   Initial registration for 5GS services
    *   Initial registration for emergency services
    *   Initial registration for SMS over NAS
    *   Movement from GERAN/UTRAN to NG-RAN
    *   Initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN
	*	Initial registration for disaster roaming services
	*	Initial registration to come out of unavailability period and resume normal services
*   **Core Action:** The UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF. The UE starts timer T3510. If timer T3502 or T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop the timer
*   **5GS Mobile Identity Handling:** The UE determines and includes the appropriate 5GS mobile identity based on factors like previously assigned GUTIs, SUCI availability, and registration type (e.g., emergency services, SNPN onboarding).
*   **Other IE Inclusion:** The UE includes other IEs in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, based on UE capabilities, network configuration, and service requirements. These IEs cover areas such as:

    *   UE status
    *   Requested NSSAI
    *   5GMM capabilities
    *   DRX parameters
    *   LADN information
    *   MICO mode
    *   S1 mode support
    *   UE policies
    *   WUS assistance information
        *V2X
*   **Timers:** The procedure involves starting and stopping timers (T3510, T3502, T3511) to manage the registration process and handle potential delays or failures.
*   **Conditional Behavior:** The procedure's exact behavior varies significantly based on several conditional factors, including:

    *   UE capabilities and supported features
    *   Network configuration
    *   Service requirements (e.g., emergency services, SNPN onboarding)
    *   Presence of valid identities (GUTI, SUCI)
    *   Mobility status (e.g., handover from GERAN/UTRAN)
    *   Disaster Roaming
