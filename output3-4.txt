Based solely on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the procedures and a detailed analysis of the fourth one, followed by its Mermaid flowchart.


**List of Procedures:**

1.  Registration procedure for initial registration
2.  5GMM common procedure initiation
3.  Initial registration accepted by the network
4.  Initial registration not accepted by the network
5.  Registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
6.  Abnormal cases in the UE
7.  Abnormal cases on the network side


**Extraction of the Fourth Procedure Information:**

**Procedure Name:** Initial registration not accepted by the network

**States:**

*   UE:  Various states are implied but not explicitly defined within this specific procedure's description. The text refers to the UE transitioning to different states after receiving a `REGISTRATION REJECT` message depending on the cause, but these states themselves aren't fully specified here.  Examples include `5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION`, `5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH`, `5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE`, and potentially others based on the `5GMM cause value`.
*   Network (AMF): The AMF is implied to remain in a state to process further registration attempts or other actions, but a specific state is not mentioned.

**Actions:**

*   UE:  The UE performs actions determined by the `5GMM cause value` received in the `REGISTRATION REJECT` message. These actions can involve setting counters to maximum values, deleting information (e.g., 5G-GUTI, TAI list), storing PLMN or SNPN identities in forbidden lists, starting timers (e.g., T3245, T3346), enabling/disabling capabilities (e.g., N1 mode), and entering different states.  The exact actions depend heavily on the cause code.
*   Network (AMF): The AMF sends a `REGISTRATION REJECT` message to the UE, including a `5GMM cause value`.  It may also include additional information depending on the cause (e.g., `CAG information list`, `RAT utilization control IE`, back-off timer `T3346`).

**Events:**

*   `REGISTRATION REJECT` message received by the UE from the AMF.

**Parameters:**

*   `REGISTRATION REJECT` message: Contains a `5GMM cause value` and potentially other information elements (IEs) depending on the cause.
*   `5GMM cause value`:  A numerical code indicating the reason for rejection.  Many specific cause values and their associated UE and AMF actions are listed.
*   Timers:  Several timers (e.g., T3245, T3346) may be started or stopped by the UE based on the cause code.
*   Counters: Various counters (e.g., registration attempt counter, PLMN-specific attempt counters) are managed by the UE.
*   Lists: Forbidden lists (e.g., forbidden PLMN list, forbidden SNPN lists) may be updated.
*   UE capabilities: States of UE features like N1 mode, S1 mode, etc., affect the procedure.

**Flow of Execution:**

1.  The network (AMF) determines that the initial registration request cannot be accepted.
2.  The AMF sends a `REGISTRATION REJECT` message to the UE, including a `5GMM cause value`.
3.  The UE receives the `REGISTRATION REJECT` message.
4.  The UE processes the `5GMM cause value` and performs the corresponding actions (which depend heavily on the `5GMM cause value` received).  This may involve updating internal states, timers, and lists and notifying upper layers.


**Conditionals:**

*   The `5GMM cause value` received in the `REGISTRATION REJECT` message determines the UE's actions.
*   Integrity protection of the `REGISTRATION REJECT` message affects the UE's response.
*   Whether the UE is in single or dual-registration mode affects its actions.
*   Whether the UE is in NB-N1 mode affects its actions.
*   The presence of additional IEs within the `REGISTRATION REJECT` message triggers specific actions (e.g., processing of a `CAG information list`).
*   Operator policies influence various decision points.

**Metadata:**

*   `5GMM cause value` acts as metadata indicating the reason for the rejection.
*   Implicit timestamps are associated with the sending and receiving of messages and timer actions.

**Description of the Fourth Procedure's Flowchart:**

The flowchart shows a simplified representation.  The core logic lies in the various `5GMM cause values` and their corresponding actions in the UE, which are extensively detailed but too numerous to fully represent in a concise flowchart. The flowchart highlights the primary steps:  the network's rejection, the sending of a `REGISTRATION REJECT` message, the UE's reception and processing based on the cause value, and finally, the UE entering a new state to handle the rejection appropriately.  The multiple branching from the "5GMM Cause Value" node represents the numerous possible cause codes each leading to a distinct set of actions within the UE.
