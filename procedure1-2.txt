| **Flow of Execution**   |  UE initiates registration (5GMM-DEREGISTERED -> 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED) -> UE sends REGISTRATION REQUEST -> Network processes request -> Network sends REGISTRATION ACCEPT or REGISTRATION REJECT -> UE processes response (5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-DEREGISTERED).  Various actions and conditionals occur within these steps based on the parameters and events. |
| **Conditionals**       |  Many conditions based on registration type, UE capabilities, network capabilities,  availability of various IEs, timer status,  emergency status, etc.  |
