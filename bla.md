Section 4 content: A 5GS can support indirect network sharing between a hosting operator and participating operators as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]. The AMF may support indirect network sharing. NOTE 1:     In this version of the specification, the support of indirect network sharing has no UE impact. NOTE 2: In case of indirect network sharing, the AMF of hosting operator acts towards to the UE as the AMF of the selected PLMN or the RPLMN. NOTE 3:      In order to support indirect network sharing deployment, when a UE of participating operator registers in the HPLMN, the HPLMN can include a PLMN ID representing the participating operator in the list of equivalent PLMNs. NOTE 4: In case of indirect network sharing, if the UE is not allowed to access the selected PLMN which represents the participating operator, the AMF of hosting operator can reject the registration request using an existing cause value. In case of indirect network sharing, during the generic UE configuration update procedure (see subclause 5.4.4), the registration procedure for initial registration (see subclause 5.5.1.2) or the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause 5.5.1.3), if the selected PLMN ID is the PLMN ID of the HPLMN or an EHPLMN of the UE, the AMF of hosting operator shall determine the available S-NSSAI(s) of hosting operator corresponding to the S-NSSAI(s) of participating operator provided by the UE and shall only use the corresponding S-NSSAI(s) of participating operator towards the UE. NOTE 5:    In this case, the AMF of hosting operator uses the determined S-NSSAI(s) of hosting operator and the corresponding S-NSSAI(s) of participating operator towards other network functions (e.g. SMF). NOTE 6:        If the selected PLMN ID is different from the PLMN ID of the HPLMN or an EHPLMN of the UE, the AMF of hosting operator can use S-NSSAI(s) of hosting operator as S-NSSAI(s) of serving PLMN, and corresponding mapped HPLMN S-NSSAI(s).
