Based on the provided text, here's a list of the procedures mentioned in the "5.5.1" section:


1. **Registration procedure for initial registration:**  This procedure is used by a UE for initial registration for various 5GS services (including emergency, onboarding, and disaster roaming).
2. **5GMM common procedure initiation:** The network may initiate procedures like identification, authentication, and security during registration.
3. **Registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update:** This procedure is for mobility and periodic updates of 5GS services.


Let's extract information for the first procedure using the provided mapping:


**Procedure 1: Registration procedure for initial registration**

* **States:**
    * UE: 5GMM-DEREGISTERED (initial state), 5GMM-REGISTERED (final state), 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED (intermediate state)
    * AMF: 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED (intermediate state)
* **Actions:**
    * UE: Sends REGISTRATION REQUEST message, starts timer T3510, stops timers T3502 and T3511, handles 5GS mobile identity IE, includes UE status IE, includes ATTACH REQUEST (if applicable), includes Additional GUTI IE (if applicable), starts timer T3519 (if applicable), sends REGISTRATION COMPLETE message (if applicable).
    * AMF: Sends REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message, assigns TAI list, stores information elements from REGISTRATION REQUEST, starts timer T3550 (under certain conditions), initiates 5GMM common procedures (authentication, security), initiates UUAA-MM procedure (if applicable), may include various IEs in REGISTRATION ACCEPT (e.g., LADN information, PEIPS information, NSSAI information, etc.)  stops timer T3550 (upon receiving REGISTRATION COMPLETE)
* **Events:**
    * Timer T3510 expiry (UE), Timer T3550 expiry (AMF), Timer T3346 expiry (UE), Timer T3447 expiry (UE), Timer T3511 expiry (UE), Timer T3526 expiry (UE),  REGISTRATION ACCEPT message received (UE), REGISTRATION REJECT message received (UE).
* **Parameters:**  Numerous IEs (Information Elements) are exchanged in REGISTRATION REQUEST and REGISTRATION ACCEPT messages.  Key examples include: 5GS registration type, 5GS mobile identity, UE status, ATTACH REQUEST, Additional GUTI, 5GMM capability, S1 UE network capability,  Requested NSSAI,  LADN indication, T3324, Requested T3512, Requested DRX parameters,  Negotiated DRX parameters,  etc.
* **Flow of Execution:** The UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST.  The AMF processes the request and sends either a REGISTRATION ACCEPT or REJECT.  If ACCEPTED, the UE acknowledges with a REGISTRATION COMPLETE (in some cases).
* **Conditionals:** Numerous conditions determine the content of messages and actions taken (e.g.,  UE's previous registration state, type of registration requested, support for specific features, network capabilities, etc.).
* **Metadata:** Timers (T3510, T3550, T3346, T3511, T3519, T3526, T3447, T3448) implicitly provide timing information.  Message types (REGISTRATION REQUEST, REGISTRATION ACCEPT, REGISTRATION REJECT, REGISTRATION COMPLETE) are explicit metadata.

```

**Description:**

The initial registration procedure begins with the UE in the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state. The UE initiates registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, including information such as the type of registration requested and the UE's identity. The AMF processes this request, potentially performing authentication and security procedures, and then sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if successful, or a REGISTRATION REJECT message if not. The REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains parameters and network capabilities that the UE uses to configure its connection.  Under certain conditions, the UE may send a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to acknowledge the successful update. The entire procedure is governed by timers and conditional logic based on various factors like network capabilities, security contexts, and the UE's support for different features.  Failure scenarios result in the UE attempting re-registration or taking other actions as defined by the rejection cause.
