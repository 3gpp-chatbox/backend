*   **Flow of Execution:**  The UE, in the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state, sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF.  The AMF processes the request and either sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT or REGISTRATION REJECT message.  Success involves security procedures and potentially other procedures, resulting in a 5GMM-REGISTERED state.  Failure results in the UE retrying or taking other actions based on the cause.  There are specific details on how different information elements (IEs) are handled in both request and acceptance messages. The overall flow includes conditional logic based on the type of registration (emergency, onboarding, etc.), UE capabilities, and network configuration.

*   **Conditionals:**  Numerous conditionals are present, determining which IEs are included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST and REGISTRATION ACCEPT messages.  Conditions include the type of registration, the availability of various GUTI and SUCI identifiers, the UE's capabilities (e.g., support for S1 mode, MICO, etc.), network support for features, and the results of authentication and authorization procedures.


*   **Metadata:**  While not explicitly listed as metadata, timers (T3510, T3502, T3511, T3519, T3346, T3550, T3447, T3448, T3245) and message types (REGISTRATION REQUEST, REGISTRATION ACCEPT, REGISTRATION REJECT, REGISTRATION COMPLETE, ATTACH REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST) act as implicit metadata, providing timing and message flow information.

**Description of Initial Registration Procedure:**

The initial registration procedure begins with the UE in the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state. The UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, which includes various information elements (IEs) depending on UE capabilities and the registration type (e.g., emergency, standard). The AMF performs authentication and security procedures, and allocates resources (including a 5G-GUTI and TAI). If successful, the AMF returns a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, containing further configuration information and setting the UE to the 5GMM-REGISTERED state.  If unsuccessful, a REGISTRATION REJECT message is sent, along with a 5GMM cause code specifying the reason for the failure.  The UE then handles the rejection, which might involve retries, alternative network selection, or other actions dependent on the cause code.  The procedure involves several timers controlling retry attempts and timeouts.  Many conditional actions depend on the specifics of the registration type and UE capabilities.
