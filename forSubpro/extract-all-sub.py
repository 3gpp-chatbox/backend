   Below is the text of a section from the 3GPP specification. This section describes a main procedure, and under it, there are several sub-procedures that collectively define the entire procedure. Read the text carefully:

{text}

Remember, all your analysis and extraction should be based on the text I provided above. Do not make any assumptions or include information from outside the provided text.

Now, analyze the text and find all sub-procedures. Please only focus on the specific sub-procedures in the text I provided. Exclude all sections marked as 'General' or anything unrelated to the core procedure flow.Identify and list only the sub-procedures in correct order. Do not include general sections or unrelated procedures.
 extract each's key information, and map it using the following pattern (example provided below). return each's Mermaid flowchart using `graph TD` syntax (for a vertical layout). Ensure that all node labels are enclosed in double quotes and there are no extra spaces inside `{{}}` brackets.in the end,also return the main procedure's key information and its Mermaid flowchart.
 that example: 

Extracting the Model from 3GPP Specification

Core Components to Identify

â–¡ States: Different conditions or statuses of the UE and network

elements.

Actions: Operations performed by the UE or network.

Events: Triggers causing transitions between states.

Parameters: Data exchanged or required during the procedure.

Flow of Execution: Sequence of steps in the procedure.

Conditionals: Decisions based on certain criteria or parameters.

Metadata: Additional information like timestamps, message types, or IDs.
